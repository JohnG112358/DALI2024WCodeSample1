33452689|t|EAACI statement on the diagnosis, management and prevention of severe allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines.
33452689|a|The first approved COVID-19 vaccines include Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162B2, Moderna mRNA-1273 and AstraZeneca recombinant adenoviral ChAdOx1-S. Soon after approval, severe allergic reactions to the mRNA-based vaccines that resolved after treatment were reported. Regulatory agencies from the European Union, Unites States and the United Kingdom agree that vaccinations are contraindicated only when there is an allergy to one of the vaccine components or if there was a severe allergic reaction to the first dose. This position paper of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) agrees with these recommendations and clarifies that there is no contraindication to administer these vaccines to allergic patients who do not have a history of an allergic reaction to any of the vaccine components. Importantly, as is the case for any medication, anaphylaxis may occur after vaccination in the absence of a history of allergic disease. Therefore, we provide a simplified algorithm of prevention, diagnosis and treatment of severe allergic reactions and a list of recommended medications and equipment for vaccine centres. We also describe potentially allergenic/immunogenic components of the approved vaccines and propose a workup to identify the responsible allergen. Close collaboration between academia, regulatory agencies and vaccine producers will facilitate approaches for patients at risks, such as incremental dosing of the second injection or desensitization. Finally, we identify unmet research needs and propose a concerted international roadmap towards precision diagnosis and management to minimize the risk of allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines and to facilitate their broader and safer use.

33567246|a|We report an imported case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant P.1 detected in an asymptomatic traveler who arrived in Italy on an indirect flight from Brazil. This case shows the risk for introduction of SARS-CoV-2 variants from indirect flights and the need for continued SARS-CoV-2 surveillance.

34925381|t|Glycan Masking of Epitopes in the NTD and RBD of the Spike Protein Elicits Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies Against SARS-CoV-2 Variants.
34925381|a|Glycan-masking the vaccine antigen by mutating the undesired antigenic sites with an additional N-linked glycosylation motif can refocus B-cell responses to desired epitopes, without affecting the antigen's overall-folded structure. This study examined the impact of glycan-masking mutants of the N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, and found that the antigenic design of the S protein increases the neutralizing antibody titers against the Wuhan-Hu-1 ancestral strain and the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Delta (B.1.617.2). Our results demonstrated that the use of glycan-masking Ad-S-R158N/Y160T in the NTD elicited a 2.8-fold, 6.5-fold, and 4.6-fold increase in the IC-50 NT titer against the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351) and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants, respectively. Glycan-masking of Ad-S-D428N in the RBD resulted in a 3.0-fold and 2.0-fold increase in the IC-50 neutralization titer against the Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Beta (B.1.351) variants, respectively. The use of glycan-masking in Ad-S-R158N/Y160T and Ad-S-D428N antigen design may help develop universal COVID-19 vaccines against current and future emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

35614536|t|Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Following SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in Two Children.
35614536|a|This report presents 2 pediatric cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children/adults (MIS-C/A) post-SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination (MIS-V). Both children presented with MIS-V within 6 weeks of receiving their first and only dose of Pfizer/BioNTech's SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The first patient had symptoms of MIS-C/A with peri-myocarditis and shock, and the second one had classic Kawasaki Disease (KD) features. Both responded well to intravenous immunoglobulins and/or systemic corticosteroids. Both children were positive only for SARS-2-CoV anti-spike (S) (and not for anti-nucleocapsid (NC)) antibodies consistent with a post-vaccine and not a post-infection event. Surveillance for rare adverse events (AE) following immunization should continue especially now that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is approved in the 5-11 year age group that has had the highest risk of developing MIS-C post SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our patients did not receive any further SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Our report highlights the importance of measuring differentiating antibodies (anti-S and anti-NC) that can be used within a specific timeframe to help determine if a patient has MIS-V post vaccine (only anti-S present), or MIS-C/A post SARS-CoV-2 infection (both anti-S and anti-NC present).

34952752|t|Did the European suspension of the AstraZeneca vaccine decrease vaccine acceptance during the COVID-19 pandemic?
34952752|a|On March 11, 2021, the AstraZeneca vaccine against COVID-19 was suspended in three Nordic countries and, on subsequent days, in other European countries. Using data on vaccine acceptance in eight Western countries obtained on a daily basis, we show that these decisions - and associated news - decreased public vaccine acceptance in several countries and part of this decrease happened in response to suspensions in other countries. The findings demonstrate the importance of international coordination between health authorities during a pandemic such that local authorities are able to put the decisions of foreign authorities into perspective.

34923570|t|Heterologous prime-boost immunizations with chimpanzee adenoviral vectors elicit potent and protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
34923570|a|A safe and effective vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is urgently needed to tackle the COVID-19 global pandemic. Here, we describe the development of chimpanzee adenovirus serotypes 6 and 68 (AdC6 and AdC68) vector-based vaccine candidates expressing the full-length transmembrane spike glycoprotein. We assessed the vaccine immunogenicity, protective efficacy, and immune cell profiles using single-cell RNA sequencing in mice. Mice were vaccinated via the intramuscular route with the two vaccine candidates using prime-only regimens or heterologous prime-boost regimens. Both chimpanzee adenovirus-based vaccines elicited strong and long-term antibody and T cell responses, balanced Th1/Th2 cell responses, robust germinal center responses, and provided effective protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in mouse lungs. Strikingly, we found that heterologous prime-boost immunization induced higher titers of protective antibodies, and more spike-specific memory CD8+ T cells in mice. Potent neutralizing antibodies produced against the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 lineage (also known as N501Y.V1) and B.1.351 lineage (also known as N501Y.V2) were detectable in mouse sera over 6 months after prime immunization. Our results demonstrate that the heterologous prime-boost strategy with chimpanzee adenovirus-based vaccines is promising for further development to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.

34983336|t|Applications of lipid-based nanocarriers for parenteral drug delivery.
34983336|a|This review describes the use of Lipid-based Nanocarriers (LNCs) for the parenteral delivery of pharmaceutical actives. Firstly, the two generation of LNCs such as ''solid lipid nanoparticles'' (SLNs) and ''nanostructured lipid carriers'' (NLCs) are explained in term of preparation, characterization and stability. Although the use of LNCs through parenteral administration has shown many benefits, their use is limited by opsonization, an immune process that causes their short half-life (3-5 min). Therefore, many strategies are discussed to realize "stealth" systems suitable for parenteral administration. Successfully, the requirements and applications of parenteral lipid nanoparticles are reviewed for the delivery of natural compounds, synthetic drugs and genetic materials. In the last period, the latter application has been a remarkable interest due to the numerous benefits of mRNA vaccines to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.

34988259|t|Trends in Clinical Severity of Hospitalized Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019-Premier Hospital Dataset, April 2020-April 2021.
34988259|a|Background: Clinical severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may vary over time; trends in clinical severity at admission during the pandemic among hospitalized patients in the United States have been incompletely described, so a historical record of severity over time is lacking. Methods: We classified 466677 hospital admissions for COVID-19 from April 2020 to April 2021 into 4 mutually exclusive severity grades based on indicators present on admission (from most to least severe): Grade 4 included intensive care unit (ICU) admission and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV); grade 3 included non-IMV ICU and/or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation; grade 2 included diagnosis of acute respiratory failure; and grade 1 included none of the above indicators. Trends were stratified by sex, age, race/ethnicity, and comorbid conditions. We also examined severity in states with high vs low Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant burden. Results: Severity tended to be lower among women, younger adults, and those with fewer comorbidities compared to their counterparts. The proportion of admissions classified as grade 1 or 2 fluctuated over time, but these less-severe grades comprised a majority (75%-85%) of admissions every month. Grades 3 and 4 consistently made up a minority of admissions (15%-25%), and grade 4 showed consistent decreases in all subgroups, including states with high Alpha variant burden. Conclusions: Clinical severity among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 has varied over time but has not consistently or markedly worsened over time. The proportion of admissions classified as grade 4 decreased in all subgroups. There was no consistent evidence of worsening severity in states with higher vs lower Alpha prevalence.

34977602|t|Humoral and cellular immune responses to two and three doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in rituximab-treated patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a prospective, cohort study.
34977602|a|Background: In rituximab-treated patients with rheumatoid arthritis, humoral and cellular immune responses after two or three doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are not well characterised. We aimed to address this knowledge gap. Methods: This prospective, cohort study (Nor-vaC) was done at two hospitals in Norway. For this sub-study, we enrolled patients with rheumatoid arthritis on rituximab treatment and healthy controls who received SARS-CoV-2 vaccines according to the Norwegian national vaccination programme. Patients with insufficient serological responses to two doses (antibody to the receptor-binding domain [RBD] of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein concentration <100 arbitrary units [AU]/mL) were allotted a third vaccine dose. Antibodies to the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were measured in serum 2-4 weeks after the second and third doses. Vaccine-elicited T-cell responses were assessed in vitro using blood samples taken before and 7-10 days after the second dose and 3 weeks after the third dose from a subset of patients by stimulating cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells with spike protein peptides. The main outcomes were the proportions of participants with serological responses (anti-RBD antibody concentrations of >=70 AU/mL) and T-cell responses to spike peptides following two and three doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04798625, and is ongoing. Findings: Between Feb 9, 2021, and May 27, 2021, 90 patients were enrolled, 87 of whom donated serum and were included in our analyses (69 [79 3%] women and 18 [20 7%] men). 1114 healthy controls were included (854 [76 7%] women and 260 [23 3%] men). 49 patients were allotted a third vaccine dose. 19 (21 8%) of 87 patients, compared with 1096 (98 4%) of 1114 healthy controls, had a serological response after two doses (p<0 0001). Time since last rituximab infusion (median 267 days [IQR 222-324] in responders vs 107 days [80-152] in non-responders) and vaccine type (mRNA-1273 vs BNT162b2) were significantly associated with serological response (adjusting for age and sex). After two doses, 10 (53%) of 19 patients had CD4+ T-cell responses and 14 (74%) had CD8+ T-cell responses. A third vaccine dose induced serological responses in eight (16 3%) of 49 patients, but induced CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses in all patients assessed (n=12), including responses to the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2). Adverse events were reported in 32 (48%) of 67 patients and in 191 (78%) of 244 healthy controls after two doses, with the frequency not increasing after the third dose. There were no serious adverse events or deaths. Interpretation: This study provides important insight into the divergent humoral and cellular responses to two and three doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in rituximab-treated patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A third vaccine dose given 6-9 months after a rituximab infusion might not induce a serological response, but could be considered to boost the cellular immune response.

34997611|t|INDUCTION OF HUMORAL AND CELLULAR IMMUNE RESPONSES TO COVID-19 mRNA AND VECTOR VACCINES: A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY IN BULGARIAN HEALTHCARE WORKERS.
34997611|a|Installing efficient protective immunity by anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is the only current means to overcome COVID-19 pandemics. The cellular and humoral immune responses induced with an mRNA (BNT162b2) or with a vector (ChAdOx1nCoV-19) vaccine among Bulgarian healthcare workers (n=123, aged 23 - 71 years) were studied in the course of 16 weeks after priming. RBD-blocking Abs, and SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain IgA were evaluated in parallel with IFNgamma-producing virus-specific T cells. Both vaccines induced RBD-blocking Abs in 100% of the participants after complete immunization while the levels of protection after a single dose largely varied (22 - 98%). Advanced age had a negative impact on the level and longevity of virus neutralizing activity induced by one dose mRNA, but not by the vector vaccine. RBD-binding IgA was detected in 100% of tested donors from the mRNA vaccine cohort, and in 67% of tested from the vector vaccine cohort, at least one month after completed immunization. One month after completed mRNA immunization, the number of IFNgamma-producing T cells correlated significantly with the levels of RBD-specific IgA and virus neutralizing activity induced after priming. Enumeration of circulating virus-specific IFNgamma+T cells is not recommended for evaluation of protective immunity as their detection may require longer stimulation beyond the first month post-immunization. In conclusion, BNT162B2 and ChAdOx1nCoV-19 induced potent and comparable humoral and cellular anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses, peaking between 10 and 30 days after complete immunization. A single dose of any vaccine did not induce adequate protection in a great part of donors, making the shorter interval between mRNA vaccine doses preferable in the settings of increased risk of infection.

35615850|a|Guillain-Barre syndrome is an acute generalized polyneuropathy which usually follows infection with a virus or bacteria, although rarely vaccination may be associated with it. We present a case of a 44-year-man who presented with progressive weakness of both lower limbs since 6?days, neurological examination findings were consistent with flaccid-type paraplegia and investigation findings including lumbar puncture and nerve conduction studies were consistent with the diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome.

35611033|t|A Rare Case of COVID-19 Vaccine-Induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia in a Young Patient.
35611033|a|The syndrome of pulmonary SARS-Cov-2 resulted in significant morbidity and mortality, with new variants spreading rapidly. Vaccines to prevent COVID-19 have been developed to minimize the impact and severity; however, adverse effects of the vaccine have been documented in several studies. In our case, we report a case of a young female who presented to the emergency department with fever, dizziness, headache, vomiting, blurring of vision, numbness, and weakness of left upper and lower limbs. This weakness progressed rapidly to all limbs within two hours associated with altered behaviors and visual hallucinations. The family reported a history of the patient receiving her first dose of COVID-19 AstraZeneca vaccine 18 days before admission. Based on her clinical picture and investigation, she was diagnosed with vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). She was treated successfully with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and direct oral anticoagulant apixaban. In a time when there is a strategic goal to vaccinate the global population from COVID-19 to inhibit the spread of infection and reduce hospitalization, this particular clinical scenario emphasizes the need for all clinicians to remain vigilant for rare complications of the COVID-19 vaccination.

34988105|t|Case Report: Circulating Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies Do Not Cross-React With Pemphigus or Pemphigoid Autoantigens.
34988105|a|It is hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to elicit autoimmunity due to molecular mimicry between immunogenic proteins of the virus and human extracellular molecules. While in silico and in vitro evaluation of such immune cross-reactivity of human antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 proteins with several different tissue antigens has been described, there is limited information specifically pertaining to the immunological effects of COVID-19 and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 on the development of autoimmune bullous diseases (AIBDs). Twelve seropositive post-COVID-19 individuals and 12 seropositive healthy volunteers who received two doses of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech have been included in this case series investigation. Serum samples of these blood donors were tested for autoantibodies to the main immunobullous autoantigens, i.e., desmoglein 1, desmoglein 3, envoplakin, BP180, BP230, and type VII collagen. Our study revealed that none of the 24 anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive subjects had concomitant antibody reactivity with any of the tested autoantigens. These results argue against a relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection/vaccines and AIBDs with respect to disease-triggering antibody cross-reactivity.

34951350|t|Differences in Antibody Responses Between an Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine and the BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine in Solid-Organ Transplant Recipients.
34951350|a|OBJECTIVES: Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 may reduce COVID-19 mortality and complications in solidorgan transplant recipients, and we evaluated the associated antibody responses and adverse effects in this high-risk population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective observational study (April-June 2021) included 10 liver and 38 kidney transplant recipients who received 2 vaccine doses (Sinovac, n = 31; or BioNTech, n = 17) and 56 healthy adults (Sinovac), all of whom provided 3 blood samples (prevaccination, 4 weeks after first dose, and 4-6 weeks after second dose) for quantitative tests (Abbott Quant assay forimmunoglobulin G antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein). Type I error was alpha = .05 in all statistical analyses (SPSS, version 25). RESULTS: We analyzed demographic data, antibody responses, and adverse events after 2 doses of SARSCoV-2 vaccine, comparedimmune responses from solidorgan transplant recipients (median age, 36.5 years) versus healthy patients (median age, 37.5 years), and observed significantly higher seropositivity in healthy versus transplant patients after Sinovac vaccination (100% vs 67.5%; P = .001). However, we observed no significant seropositive differences for Sinovac versus BioNTech second doses in transplantrecipients. Median SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G level after second dose was significantly higher in BioNTech (1388.6 AU/mL) versus Sinovac patients (136.6 AU/mL) (P = .012). The seropositivity difference between the 2 vaccines was significant in participants 24 to 44 years old (P = .040). The rate of at least 1 side effect was 82.4% (n = 14) for BioNTech vaccine and 32.3% (n = 10) for Sinovac vaccine, and the difference was statistically significant.The most common side effect was arm pain (significantly higher in BioNTech group). CONCLUSIONS: Solid-organ transplant recipients demonstrated inadequate vaccine responses (higher risk of complications and mortality) versus healthy patients. Furthermore, immune responses may differ between vaccines. Therefore, additional vaccine doses and strict control measures remain crucial.

35632550|t|The SARS-CoV-2 Variant Omicron Is Able to Escape Vaccine-Induced Humoral Immune Responses, but Is Counteracted by Booster Vaccination.
35632550|a|The SARS-CoV-2 variant Omicron has spread world-wide and is responsible for rapid increases in infections, including in populations with high vaccination rates. Here, we analysed in the sera of vaccinated individuals the antibody binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein and the neutralization of wild-type (WT), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (B.1.1.529; BA.1) pseudotyped vectors. Although sera from individuals immunized with vector vaccines (Vaxzevria; AZ and COVID-19 Janssen, Ad26.COV2.S; J&J) were able to bind and neutralize WT and Delta, they showed only background levels towards Omicron. In contrast, mRNA (Comirnaty; BNT) or heterologous (AZ/BNT) vaccines induced weak, but detectable responses against Omicron. While RBD-binding antibody levels decreased significantly six months after full vaccination, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-directed avidity remained constant. However, this still coincided with a significant decrease in neutralization activity against all variants. A third booster vaccination with BNT significantly increased the humoral immune responses against all tested variants, including Omicron. In conclusion, only vaccination schedules that included at least one dose of mRNA vaccine and especially an mRNA booster vaccination induced sufficient antibody levels with neutralization capacity against multiple variants, including Omicron.

34943453|t|Correlation between Commercial Anti-RBD IgG Titer and Neutralization Titer against SARS-CoV-2 Beta Variant.
34943453|a|OBJECTIVES: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) have diminished the effectiveness of vaccines and are associated with a rebound in the number of COVID-19 cases globally. These variants contain mutations at the spike (S) protein receptor binding site (RBD), which affect antibody binding. Current commercially available antibody assays were developed before the VOCs emerged. It is unclear whether the levels of these commercially available antibody assays can predict the neutralizing antibody titers against the VOCs. In this study, we sought to determine the correlation between the binding antibody concentration and microneutralization antibody titer against the beta variant. METHODS: This study included 58 COVID-19 patients. The concentrations of IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD and nucleocapsid (N) protein were measured using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assay and the SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, respectively. The neutralization antibody titer against the wild type lineage A SARS-CoV-2 and against the beta variant (B.1.351) was determined using a conventional live virus neutralization test. RESULTS: The geometric mean MN titer (GMT) against the beta variant was significantly lower than that against the wild type lineage A virus (5.6 vs. 47.3, p < 0.0001). The anti-RBD IgG had a better correlation with the neutralizing antibody titer than that of the anti-N IgG assay against the wild type lineage A virus (Spearman rho, 0.5901 vs. 0.3827). However, the correlation between the anti-RBD or the anti-N IgG and the MN titer against the beta variant was poor. CONCLUSIONS: Currently available commercial antibody assays may not predict the level of neutralizing antibodies against the variants. A new generation of antibody tests specific for variants are required.

35617193|t|High prevalence of an alpha variant lineage with a premature stop codon in ORF7a in Iraq, winter 2020-2021.
35617193|a|Since the first reported case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading worldwide. Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 has had a critical role in tracking the emergence, introduction, and spread of new variants, which may affect transmissibility, pathogenicity, and escape from infection or vaccine-induced immunity. As anticipated, the rapid increase in COVID-19 infections in Iraq in February 2021 is due to the introduction of variants of concern during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. To understand the molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 during the second wave in Iraq (2021), we sequenced 76 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes using NGS technology and identified genomic mutations and proportions of circulating variants among these. Also, we performed an in silico study to predict the effect of the truncation of NS7a protein (ORF7a) on its function. We detected nine different lineages of SARS-CoV-2. The B.1.1.7 lineage was predominant (80.20%) from February to May 2021, while only one B.1.351 strain was detected. Interestingly, the phylogenetic analysis showed that multiple strains of the B.1.1.7 lineage clustered closely with those from European countries. A notable frequency (43.33%) of stop codon mutation (NS7a Q62stop) was detected among the B.1.1.7 lineage sequences. In silico analysis of NS7a with Q62stop found that this stop codon had no considerable effect on the function of NS7a. This work provides molecular epidemiological insights into the spread variants of SARS-CoV-2 in Iraq, which are most likely imported from Europe.

34987246|t|Knowledge, Attitude, Practice and Stigma Related to COVID-19: A Nigerian Perspective.
34987246|a|Pandemics have claimed an estimated 414 million lives from 165 AD to present, with COVID-19 pandemic killing close to 2 million people. The best counter for pandemics has been the use of vaccines, but before it is widely available, the best strategy is to avoid being infected. COVID-19 pandemic was met by behaviours and attitudes ranging from unbelief to fear of dying and stigmatisation of those who have contracted the virus or recovered from the disease. This study aimed to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, practices (KAP), fear and stigma of the populace towards COVID-19 from state to state. This research was a cross-sectional study carried out from April to October 2020. Data was obtained through a structured questionnaire distributed to 650 individuals. Respondents who participated were 591 (males n= 335 and females n= 256) and aged 18-60 years (mean age 30.25 +- 10.45 years, range 18-60) drawn from five states in the north-central region of Nigeria. The results show that 98.3% of participants believe that COVID-19 disease exists. Still, not everyone wears face masks, avoid crowded places, practice social distancing or follow the WHO-hand-washing technique as measures to curb the spread of the disease. Only 60.5% of the participants believe that lockdown is an effective measure to reduce transmission risk. 55.6% will stigmatise those who just recovered from the disease, 75.3% are afraid to visit high-risk areas as part of the protective measures, but only about 12% believe that every infected person will die. More males (28.3%) than females (17.6%) believe that taking herbs can cure the disease (P<0.01). All government and nongovernmental organizations must develop more awareness programs to win the battle against COVID-19 disease as the second wave is emerging.

33295610|t|Biotechnology, nanotechnology and medicine.
33295610|a|The 1980s mark the starting point of nanotechnology: the capacity to synthesise, manipulate and visualise matter at the nanometre scale. New powers to reach the nanoscale brought us the unprecedented possibility to directly target at the scale of biomolecular interactions, and the motivation to create smart nanostructures that could circumvent the hurdles hindering the success of traditional pharmacological approaches. Forty years on, the progressive integration of bio- and nanotechnologies is starting to produce a transformation of the way we detect, treat and monitor diseases and unresolved medical problems [ 1]. While much of the work remains in research laboratories, the first nano-based treatments, vaccines, drugs, and diagnostic devices, are now receiving approval for commercialisation and clinical use. In this special issue we review recent advances of nanomedical approaches to combat antibiotic resistance, treatment and detection of cancers, targeting neurodegerative diseases, and applications as diverse as dentistry and the treatment of tuberculosis. We also examine the use of advanced smart nanostructured materials in areas such as regenerative medicine, and the controlled release of drugs and treatments. The latter is currently poised to bring ground-breaking changes in immunotherapy: the advent of 'vaccine implants' that continuously control and improve immune responses over time. With the increasingly likely prospect of ending the COVID 19 pandemic with the aid of a nanomedicine-based vaccine (both Moderna and BioNTech/Pfizer vaccines are based on lipid nanoparticle formulations), we are witnessing the coming of age of nanomedicine. This makes it more important than ever to concentrate on safety: in parallel to pursuing the benefits of nanomedine, we must strengthen the continuous focus on nanotoxicology and safety regulation of nanomedicines that can deliver the medical revolution that is within our grasp.

34969543|t|COVID-19 vaccine is correlated with favourable epidemiological indicators in the Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes region (France): An ecological study.
34969543|a|COVID-19 vaccination has proven to be effective in preventing severe cases, reducing viral load, and transmissibility. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of vaccination 11 months after implementation on epidemiological indicators and the effective reproduction number in one French region. We plotted four indicators with vaccination coverage as the explaining variable and estimated the impact of vaccination using the reduction rates in infections and hospital admissions. A reduction of 98% in COVID-19-related hospitalisation 11 months after the vaccine campaign began in January 2021 has been reported while vaccine coverage increased over time. Those results do not make it possible to postulate a causal relationship but do support the effect of vaccination against multiple variants of concern. Non-pharmaceutical measures remain necessary to attain complete epidemic control. Open epidemiological data should be considered to monitor vaccine effectiveness wherever possible.

34960189|t|Antibody Response of BNT162b2 and CoronaVac Platforms in Recovered Individuals Previously Infected by COVID-19 against SARS-CoV-2 Wild Type and Delta Variant.
34960189|a|Vaccinating recovered patients previously infected by COVID-19 with mRNA vaccines to boost their immune response against wild-type viruses (WT), we aimed to investigate whether vaccine platform and time of vaccination affect immunogenicity against the SARS-CoV-2 WT and Delta variant (DV). Convalescent patients infected by COVID-19 were recruited and received one booster dose of the BNT162b2 (PC-B) or CoronaVac (PC-C) vaccines, while SARS-CoV-2 naive subjects received two doses of the BNT162b2 (CN-B) or CoronaVac (CN-C) vaccines. The neutralizing antibody in sera against the WT and DV was determined with live virus neutralization assay (vMN). The vMN geometric mean titre (GMT) against WT in recovered individuals previously infected by COVID-19 reduced significantly from 60.0 (95% confidence interval (CI), 46.5-77.4) to 33.9 (95% CI, 26.3-43.7) at 6 months post recovery. In the PC-B group, the BNT162b2 vaccine enhanced antibody response against WT and DV, with 22.3-fold and 20.4-fold increases, respectively. The PC-C group also showed 1.8-fold and 2.2-fold increases for WT and DV, respectively, after receiving the CoronaVac vaccine. There was a 10.6-fold increase in GMT in the CN-B group and a 1.3-fold increase in the CN-C group against DV after full vaccination. In both the PC-B and PC-C groups, there was no difference between GMT against WT and DV after vaccination. Subjects in the CN-B and CN-C groups showed inferior GMT against DV compared with GMT against WT after vaccination. In this study, one booster shot effectively enhanced the pre-existing neutralizing activity against WT and DV in recovered subjects.

34972616|t|Near future image of orthopedics after COVID-19 pandemic.
34972616|a|The pandemic of the new coronavirus infection has swept the world and killed more than 5 million people, which has shocked all human beings who have believed in modern medical progress. Along with the sedation of infections, the balance between restriction and acceleration of socio-economic activities is difficult. With the spread of vaccines and the advent of viral therapeutic agents, we expect how to control this pandemic has finally become visible. In this situation, we realize that data science and robotics innovations are quite important in many medical fields. Artificial intelligence (AI) diagnosis and remote medical care are becoming a reality, and this direction will accelerate further in 2022, the first year of post-pandemic. The trend of digital transformation (Dx) will also be rushing into Orthopedics next year. In addition, research on virtual reality and augmented reality is being actively conducted, and it has become possible to use it for surgical simulation and technical training. As, in the field of abdominal surgery, remote robotic surgery will soon become available in the field of orthopedics as well. These Dx trend will prevail to our field instead of experience, and knowledge of medicine, which can change the medical care style dramatically in near future. It is crucial for orthopedic surgeons to always aim for its development and evolution.

34989664|t|Obatoclax inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry by altered endosomal acidification and impaired cathepsin and furin activity in vitro.
34989664|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has set off a global pandemic. There is an urgent unmet need for safe, affordable, and effective therapeutics against COVID-19. In this regard, drug repurposing is considered as a promising approach. We assessed the compounds that affect the endosomal acidic environment by applying human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)-expressing cells infected with a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-pseudotyped HIV reporter virus and identified that obatoclax resulted in the strongest inhibition of S-protein-mediated virus entry. The potent antiviral activity of obatoclax at nanomolar concentrations was confirmed in different human lung and intestinal cells infected with the SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype system as well as clinical virus isolates. Furthermore, we uncovered that obatoclax executes a double-strike against SARS-CoV-2. It prevented SARS-CoV-2 entry by blocking endocytosis of virions through diminished endosomal acidification and the corresponding inhibition of the enzymatic activity of the endosomal cysteine protease cathepsin L. Additionally, obatoclax impaired the SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated membrane fusion by targeting the MCL-1 protein and reducing furin protease activity. In accordance with these overarching mechanisms, obatoclax blocked the virus entry mediated by different S proteins derived from several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern such as, Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Delta (B.1.617.2). Taken together, our results identified obatoclax as a novel effective antiviral compound that keeps SARS-CoV-2 at bay by blocking both endocytosis and membrane fusion. Our data suggested that obatoclax should be further explored as clinical drug for the treatment of COVID-19.

34969542|t|Immunogenicity of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 with 12-dose vials: An interim analysis.
34969542|a|BACKGROUND: ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD 1222) is the main vaccine planned for general administration in Thailand. This vaccine is stored in multiple-dose vials meant to be administered to 10 recipients with a volume of 0.5 mL for each dose. However, the vaccine vials were overfilled, which allows the administration of more than 10 doses per vial. We have stipulated the preparation and use of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine using traditional 21 or 25G needles and planned to investigate the immune responses of participants who were administered the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine using this technique. METHODS: We measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike RBD IgG and neutralising antibody using a surrogate virus neutralising test (sVNT) among adults aged 18-72 years on average of 8.57 weeks (IQR 6.85-8.93) after the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. The primary outcome was the antibody level. The secondary outcomes included adverse events, factors affecting antibody levels, and incidence of COVID-19 infection. FINDINGS: In all, 60 participants comprised 25 males and 35 females. The mean age was 53.70 +- 17.48 years. BMI was 23.45 +- 3.69 kg/m2. Tests for the neutralising antibody were positive in 60% of the participants (71.4% among males and 44% among females). The median anti-SARS-CoV-2 QuantiVac (anti-spike IgG) level among male and female samples was 111.83 BAU/mL (IQR 73.48-196.74 BAU/mL) and 159.65 BAU/mL (IQR 100.39-371.81), respectively. The positive QuantiVac value of male and female samples was 88.00% and 98.44%, respectively (p-value = 0.382) .A good correlation was observed between neutralising Ab and anti-spike RBD IgG. CONCLUSION: Patients receiving 12-dose per vial injections of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 exhibited high levels of immunity without severe side effects. This technique can be adopted to maximise the number of doses per vial while preserving vaccine effectiveness.

33629336|t|COVID-19 vaccines: comparison of biological, pharmacological characteristics and adverse effects of Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Vaccines.
33629336|a|OBJECTIVE: The "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)" disease has caused a worldwide challenging and threatening pandemic (COVID-19), with huge health and economic losses. The US Food and Drug Administration, (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization for treatment with the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. Many people have a history of a significant allergic reaction to a specific food, medicine, or vaccine; hence, people all over the world have great concerns about these two authorized vaccines. This article compares the pharmacology, indications, contraindications, and adverse effects of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The required documents and information were collected from the relevant databases, including Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics), PubMed, EMBASE, World Health Organization (WHO), Food and Drug Authorities (FDA) USA, Local Ministries, Health Institutes, and Google Scholar. The key terms used were: Coronavirus, SARS-COV-2, COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines, Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, Moderna vaccine, pharmacology, benefits, allergic responses, indications, contraindications, and adverse effects. The descriptive information was recorded, and we eventually included 12 documents including research articles, clinical trials, and websites to record the required information. RESULTS: Based on the currently available literature, both vaccines are beneficial to provide immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pfizer/BioNTech Vaccine has been recommended to people 16 years of age and older, with a dose of 30 mug (0.3 m) at a cost of $19.50. It provides immunogenicity for at least 119 days after the first vaccination and is 95% effective in preventing the SARS-COV-2 infection. However, Moderna Vaccine has been recommended to people 18 years of age and older, with a dose of 50 mug (0.5 mL) at a cost of $32-37. It provides immunogenicity for at least 119 days after the first vaccination and is 94.5% effective in preventing the SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, some associated allergic symptoms have been reported for both vaccines. The COVID-19 vaccines can cause mild adverse effects after the first or second doses, including pain, redness or swelling at the site of vaccine shot, fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, itching, chills, and joint pain, and can also rarely cause anaphylactic shock. The occurrence of adverse effects is reported to be lower in the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine compared to the Moderna vaccine; however, the Moderna vaccine compared to the Pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: The FDA has granted emergency use authorization for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. These vaccines can protect recipients from a SARS-CoV- 2 infection by formation of antibodies and provide immunity against a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both vaccines can cause various adverse effects, but these reactions are reported to be less frequent in the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine compared to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine; however, the Moderna vaccine compared to the Pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive.

34982663|t|Innovative Vaccines to Fight COVID-19, Other Viruses.
34982663|a|COVID-19 added urgency to the quest for the development of new vaccines, and academic researchers and biotechnology companies responded by capitalizing on already-in-the-pipeline advances and swiftly transitioning products from the lab to the clinic. Their efforts reaped rewards. According to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services analysis, the COVID vaccines delivered in the USA from January to May 2021 resulted in 39,000 fewer deaths and 107,000 fewer hospitalizations, and prevented another 265,000 cases among Medicare recipients alone [1].

34987111|t|Comprehensive Immune Profiling Reveals CD56+ Monocytes and CD31+ Endothelial Cells Are Increased in Severe COVID-19 Disease.
34987111|a|Immune response dysregulation plays a key role in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogenesis. In this study, we evaluated immune and endothelial blood cell profiles of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to determine critical differences between those with mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 using spectral flow cytometry. We examined a suite of immune phenotypes, including monocytes, T cells, NK cells, B cells, endothelial cells, and neutrophils, alongside surface and intracellular markers of activation. Our results showed progressive lymphopenia and depletion of T cell subsets (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+) in patients with severe disease and a significant increase in the CD56+CD14+Ki67+IFN-gamma+ monocyte population in patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 that has not been previously described. Enhanced circulating endothelial cells (CD45-CD31+CD34+CD146+), circulating endothelial progenitors (CD45-CD31+CD34+/-CD146-), and neutrophils (CD11b+CD66b+) were coevaluated for COVID-19 severity. Spearman correlation analysis demonstrated the synergism among age, obesity, and hypertension with upregulated CD56+ monocytes, endothelial cells, and decreased T cells that lead to severe outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Circulating monocytes and endothelial cells may represent important cellular markers for monitoring postacute sequelae and impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection during convalescence and for their role in immune host defense in high-risk adults after vaccination.

34970509|t|SARS-CoV-2: Emergence of New Variants and Effectiveness of Vaccines.
34970509|a|The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants may cause resistance at the immunity level against current vaccines. Some emergent new variants have increased transmissibility, infectivity, hospitalization, and mortality. Since the administration of the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to a human in March 2020, there is an ongoing global race against SARS-CoV-2 to control the current pandemic situation. Spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is the main target for current vaccine development, which can neutralize the infection. Companies and academic institutions have developed vaccines based on the S glycoprotein, as well as its antigenic domains and epitopes, which have been proven effective in generating neutralizing antibodies. The effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and other therapeutics developments are limited by the new emergent variants at the global level. We have discussed the emergent variants of SARS-CoV-2 on the efficacy of developed vaccines. Presently, most of the vaccines have been tremendously effective in severe diseases. However, there are still noteworthy challenges in certifying impartial vaccines; the stories of re-infections are generating more stressful conditions, and this needs further clinical evaluation.

34980786|t|The strategy behind Japan's response to COVID-19 from 2020-2021 and future challenges posed by the uncertainty of the Omicron variant in 2022.
34980786|a|Japan has experienced five waves of the COVID-19 pandemic so far. Four states of emergency were declared, and the Tokyo 2020 Olympic (July 23-August 8, 2021) and Paralympic Games (August 24-September 5, 2021) were held during the fifth wave of the pandemic. Although a record 5,773 new cases were reported in Tokyo on August 13, the number abruptly decreased afterwards, and only 9 new cases were confirmed in Tokyo on November 1, 2021. The high vaccination rates (79.2% of the total population has received the first dose and 77.8% has received the second dose as of December 24, 2021) and behavioral changes (such as mask wearing rate in public places remains close to 100%) are considered to be important factors in curbing the spread of the virus. However, the new Omicron variant poses future challenges due to its uncertainty. A cumulative total of 231 cases of the Omicron variant were reported in Japan between November 30 and December 25, 2021. Preliminary data indicated that the Omicron variant could be more contagious but less deadly than the Delta variant. Since mankind may be forced to coexist with COVID-19, efforts such as vaccination campaigns will need to continue and behavioral changes will become increasingly important as the "new normal" to reduce population density and contact with people. This is evinced at least in Japan's successful practices in fighting the past five waves of the pandemic.

32997001|t|Genomic and phylogenetic characterisation of an imported case of SARS-CoV-2 in Amazonas State, Brazil.
32997001|a|A new coronavirus [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] is currently causing a life-threatening pandemic. In this study, we report the complete genome sequencing and genetic characterisation of a SARS-CoV-2 detected in Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil, and the protocol we designed to generate high-quality SARS-CoV-2 full genome data. The isolate was obtained from an asymptomatic carrier returning from Madrid, Spain. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed a total of nine mutations in comparison with the original human case in Wuhan, China, and support this case as belonging to the recently proposed lineage A.2. Phylogeographic analysis further confirmed the likely European origin of this case. To our knowledge, this is the first SARS-CoV-2 genome obtained from the North Brazilian Region. We believe that the information generated in this study may contribute to the ongoing efforts toward the SARS-CoV-2 emergence.

33388478|t|mRNA Vaccines to Prevent COVID-19 Disease and Reported Allergic Reactions: Current Evidence and Suggested Approach.
33388478|a|The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for 2 highly effective coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. This has brought hope to millions of Americans in the midst of an ongoing global pandemic. The FDA EUA guidance for both vaccines is to not administer the vaccine to individuals with a known history of a severe allergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) to any component of the COVID-19 vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) additionally advises individuals with a history of an immediate allergic reaction to a vaccine or injectable or any history of anaphylaxis be observed for 30 minutes after COVID-19 vaccination. All other individuals should be observed for 15 minutes after COVID-19 vaccination. Staff at vaccine clinics must be able to identify and manage anaphylaxis. Post-FDA EUA, despite very strong safety signals in both phase 3 trials, reports of possible allergic reactions have raised public concern. To provide reassurance and support during widespread global vaccination, allergists must offer clear guidance to individuals based on the best information available, but also in accordance with the broader recommendations of regulatory agencies. This review summarizes vaccine allergy epidemiology and proposes drug and vaccine allergy expert opinion informed risk stratification for Allergy specialist use in conjunction with guidance of public health and regulatory authorities. The risk stratification schema guide care for (1) individuals with different allergy histories to safely receive their first mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and (2) individuals who develop a reaction to their first dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.

32663912|t|An mRNA Vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 - Preliminary Report.
32663912|a|BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 and spread globally, prompting an international effort to accelerate development of a vaccine. The candidate vaccine mRNA-1273 encodes the stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label trial including 45 healthy adults, 18 to 55 years of age, who received two vaccinations, 28 days apart, with mRNA-1273 in a dose of 25 mug, 100 mug, or 250 mug. There were 15 participants in each dose group. RESULTS: After the first vaccination, antibody responses were higher with higher dose (day 29 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay anti-S-2P antibody geometric mean titer [GMT], 40,227 in the 25-mug group, 109,209 in the 100-mug group, and 213,526 in the 250-mug group). After the second vaccination, the titers increased (day 57 GMT, 299,751, 782,719, and 1,192,154, respectively). After the second vaccination, serum-neutralizing activity was detected by two methods in all participants evaluated, with values generally similar to those in the upper half of the distribution of a panel of control convalescent serum specimens. Solicited adverse events that occurred in more than half the participants included fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. Systemic adverse events were more common after the second vaccination, particularly with the highest dose, and three participants (21%) in the 250-mug dose group reported one or more severe adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The mRNA-1273 vaccine induced anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in all participants, and no trial-limiting safety concerns were identified. These findings support further development of this vaccine. (Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and others; mRNA-1273 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04283461).

34980605|t|Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the utilisation of health services at public hospitals in Yemen: a retrospective comparative study.
34980605|a|BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global crisis, creating an unprecedented situation, which has taken the world by storm, overshadowing on all life' aspects and having a significant impact on the health systems of most countries. In this study, the delivery of health services is investigated both before and during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic at public hospitals in Yemen to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the utilisation of health services. METHOD: Data collected from 127 hospitals in Yemen were reviewed using the DHIS2 system. The data represented 3 months before the outbreak of COVID-19 between January and March 2020 and during the outbreak of COVID-19 outbreak between April and June 2020. The results were then compared with the same period in 2019. The utilisation pattern of healthcare services during the period of investigation was compiled and analysed by applying a generalised estimating equation (GEE) to examine the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak in Yemen. The data collected from the targeted hospitals included information related to consultations, surgeries, deliveries, C-sections and penta-3rd dose immunisation. RESULTS: The trendline of health services used during the pandemic showed a gradual decline beginning from April 2020 for consultations, surgeries and penta-3rd dose utilisation. The GEE model revealed a significant effect (p<0.05) during the outbreak compared with preoutbreak in the consultation services (B=-1,343.9; 95% CI -1,767.2 to -920.6; chi2=38.718), surgeries (B=-54.98; 95% CI -79.13 to -30.83, chi2=19.911) and penta-3rd dose (B=-24.47; 95% CI -30.56 to -18.38 and chi2=62.010). As for deliveries and C-sections, the results were shown to be statistically non-significant. CONCLUSION: The impact of COVID-19 on continuity of health services delivery in Yemen has been distinct and profound, where the study revealed that the number of the consultations, surgeries and number of vaccinated children have been declined during the COVID-19 pandemic, likely due to the partially lockdown measures taken and fear of being infected. However, the deliveries and C-section services remained nearly in the same level and did not affect by the COVID-19 pandemic.

33521604|t|Immunogenicity and protective efficacy of BBV152, whole virion inactivated SARS- CoV-2 vaccine candidates in the Syrian hamster model.
33521604|a|The availability of a safe and effective vaccine would be the eventual measure to deal with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) threat. Here, we have assessed the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates BBV152A, BBV152B, and BBV152C in Syrian hamsters. Three dose vaccination regimes with vaccine candidates induced significant titers of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies. BBV152A and BBV152B vaccine candidates remarkably generated a quick and robust immune response. Post-SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccinated hamsters did not show any histopathological changes in the lungs. The protection of the hamster was evident by the rapid clearance of the virus from lower respiratory tract, reduced virus load in upper respiratory tract, absence of lung pathology, and robust humoral immune response. These findings confirm the immunogenic potential of the vaccine candidates and further protection of hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2. Of the three candidates, BBV152A showed the better response.

35632579|t|COVID-19 Vaccination Might Induce Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome Attacks: A Case Report.
35632579|a|A 30-year-old male diagnosed three years previously with reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) presented to the department of neurology with an accumulation of attacks mimicking previous RCVS attacks and fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for RCVS after receiving the first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The neurologic exam, blood samples, electrocardiogram (ECG), and computer tomography of the head (CTC) were normal. The patient was treated with the angiotensin 2 receptor antagonist, losartan, with a good response and was discharged with a prescription for losartan lasting until three days after the second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. No further RCVS attacks were reported. These findings indicate that the COVID-19 vaccine might induce RCVS attacks in susceptible individuals, and targeting the angiotensin 2 receptor could be a preventive option.

34934549|t|First Case of Erythema Nodosum Associated With Pfizer Vaccine.
34934549|a|Vaccine-related erythema nodosum is uncommon, especially after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. This study presents the first case of the Pfizer vaccine associated with erythema nodosum. A 22-year-old healthy woman presented with a five-day history of several red painful areas with swelling in the lower extremities that started one day after receiving the first dose of Pfizer vaccine. Past medical history, laboratory investigation, and chest radiograph revealed normal results. Erythema nodosum is an immune reaction that manifests as multiple, painful nodules commonly seen on the shin that resolved spontaneously two to eight weeks after the onset. In the absence of laboratory and chest radiograph abnormalities and shortly after receiving the Pfizer vaccine, vaccine-related erythema nodosum is the only possible explanation.

34960123|t|Clinical Phenotype and Contagiousness of Early Breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 Infections after BNT162b2 COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine: A Parallel Cohort Study in Healthcare Workers.
34960123|a|We evaluated the clinical protection of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in healthcare workers (HCWs) and how COVID-19 manifestations and contagiousness change as the time since first dose increases. A matched (1:2 ratio) parallel cohort study was performed. During the first three months of vaccination campaign, HCWs of the entire health district ASL Citta di Torino (Turin, Italy) were classified according to SARS-CoV-2-positivity in respect of the vaccination schedule: post-first-dose (fHCWs, <12 days), partially (PHCWs, >=12 from first dose to <=7 days after the second), and totally vaccinated (THCWs, >=8 days after the second dose). Age-/sex-matched unvaccinated controls were randomly selected from all the SARS-CoV-2-positivity detected in the same district and period. Previous infections were excluded. Clinical and virologic data (ORF1ab gene cycle threshold values, Ct) were recorded. In total, 6800 HCWs received at least one dose, and 55 tested positive subsequently: 20 fHCWs, 25 PHCWs, 10 THCWs. Furthermore, 21.8% of breakthrough infections were in male, with a median age of 49 years (32-56), and 51.4% occurred while SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant was predominant. The incident relative risk was 0.13 (0.12-0.15) for PHCWs and 0.06 (0.05-0.07) for THCWs. Compared to controls (n = 110), no difference was observed in fHCWs, while PHCWs and THCWs showed higher prevalence of asymptomatic infections, fewer signs/symptoms with a milder systemic involvement, and significantly higher Ct values (PHCWs 30.3 (24.1-35.5) vs. 22.3 (19.6-30.6), p = 0.023; THCWs 35.0 (31.3-35.9) vs. 22.5 (18.2-30.6), p = 0.024). Duration of symptoms was also shorter in THCWs (5 days (3-6) vs. 9 (7-14), p = 0.028). A linear increase of 3.81 points in Ct values was observed across the groups by vaccination status (p = 0.001) after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, and time between COVID-19 onset and swab collection. BNT162b2 decreased the risk of PCR-confirmed infections and severe disease, and was associated with a virologic picture of lesser epidemiologic concern as soon as 12 days after the first vaccine dose.

34981682|t|SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant Breakthrough Infection and Onward Secondary Transmission in Household.
34981682|a|BACKGROUND: Despite the extraordinary speed of mass vaccination efforts, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) delta variant in a vaccinee with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA vaccine was identified in an adult day service center (ADSC) of Jeju, South Korea. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the epidemiologic features in infection-vulnerable facilities with a high vaccination rate of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. The second was to estimate the secondary transmission prevention effect of the vaccine in the household members by vaccination status. METHODS: We included all ADSC participants, staff and their household members. All COVID-19 infected cases were confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. We calculated attack rate in ADSC and the secondary attack rate (SAR) in household members by vaccination status. RESULTS: Among a total of 42 participants and 16 staff, of which 96.6% were fully vaccinated with BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, 12 symptomatic cases and 13 asymptomatic confirmed cases of COVID-19 were found. The attack rate was 43.1%, with 13 isolates identified as SARS-CoV-2 virus, delta variant. The SAR in unvaccinated and partially vaccinated household members were 27.8% (5/18) and 25.0% (5/20), respectively, while the SAR in fully vaccinated household members was 12.5% (1/8). CONCLUSION: We describe a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant outbreak in ADSC with high vaccine coverage rate, characterized by high infection rate, high transmissibility, and low clinical severity. The outbreak proceeded to unvaccinated or partially vaccinated household members, emphasizing the need for immunizing close contacts of high-risk groups.

34961780|t|Detection of persistent SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in oral mucosal fluid and upper respiratory tract specimens following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination.
34961780|a|COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are highly effective at preventing COVID-19. Prior studies have found detectable SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in oral mucosal specimens of participants with history of COVID-19. To assess the development of oral SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies among people who received either the Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination series, we developed a novel SARS-CoV-2 IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to quantify the concentrations of oral and nasal mucosal SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels. We enrolled 52 participants who received the Moderna vaccine and 80 participants who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Oral mucosal specimens were self-collected by participants prior to or on the day of vaccination, and on days 5, 10, 15, and 20 following each vaccination dose and 30, 60, and 90 days following the second vaccination dose. A subset of the cohort provided additional nasal mucosal specimens at every time point. All participants developed detectable oral mucosal SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by 15 days after the first vaccination dose. There were no significant differences in oral mucosal antibody concentrations once participants were fully vaccinated in the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines. Oral or nasal mucosal antibody testing could be an inexpensive and less invasive alternative to serum antibody testing. Further research is needed to understand the duration of detectable oral or nasal mucosal antibodies and how antibody concentrations change with time.

33320183|t|Efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines in older people.
33320183|a|Several vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are on the cusp of regulatory approval. Their safety and efficacy in older people is critical to their success. Even though care home residents and older people are likely to be amongst the first to be vaccinated, these patient groups are usually excluded from clinical trials. Data from several Phase II trials have given cause for optimism, with strong antibody responses and reassuring safety profiles but, with the exception of AstraZeneca's vaccine, recruited few older people. Overall, the sparse data from Phase II trials suggest a reduction in both antibody responses and mild to moderate adverse events in well older people compared to younger participants. Many of the Phase III trials have made a conscious effort to recruit older people, and interim analyses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine have led to press releases announcing high degrees of efficacy. However, older people with co-morbidities and frailty have once again been largely excluded and there are no published data on safety and efficacy in this group. Although the speed and impact of the pandemic on older people with frailty justify an approach where they are offered vaccination first, patients and their carers and supervising health care professionals alike will need to make a decision on accepting vaccination based on limited evidence. Here we review the main candidate vaccines that may become available, with a focus on the evidence of safety and efficacy in older people.

34928334|t|Neutralizing Antibody Response to Pseudotype SARS-CoV-2 Differs between mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 COVID-19 Vaccines and by History of SARS-CoV-2 Infection.
34928334|a|BACKGROUND: Data on the development of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 after SARS-CoV-2 infection and after vaccination with messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccines are limited. METHODS: From a prospective cohort of 3,975 adult essential and frontline workers tested weekly from August 2020 to March 2021 for SARS-CoV-2 infection by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay irrespective of symptoms, 497 participants had sera drawn after infection (170), vaccination (327), and after both infection and vaccination (50 from the infection population). Serum was collected after infection and each vaccine dose. Serum-neutralizing antibody titers against USA-WA1/2020-spike pseudotype virus were determined by the 50% inhibitory dilution. Geometric mean titers (GMTs) and corresponding fold increases were calculated using t-tests and linear mixed effects models. RESULTS: Among 170 unvaccinated participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 158 (93%) developed neutralizing antibodies (nAb) with a GMT of 1,003 (95% CI=766-1,315). Among 139 previously uninfected participants, 138 (99%) developed nAb after mRNA vaccine dose-2 with a GMT of 3,257 (95% CI = 2,596-4,052). GMT was higher among those receiving mRNA-1273 vaccine (GMT =4,698, 95%CI= 3,186-6,926) compared to BNT162b2 vaccine (GMT=2,309, 95%CI=1,825-2,919). Among 32 participants with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, GMT was 21,655 (95%CI=14,766-31,756) after mRNA vaccine dose-1, without further increase after dose-2. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of mRNA vaccine after SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in the highest observed nAb response. Two doses of mRNA vaccine in previously uninfected participants resulted in higher nAb to SARS-CoV-2 than after one dose of vaccine or SARS-CoV-2 infection alone. Neutralizing antibody response also differed by mRNA vaccine product.

34952647|t|Marketing authorization of COVID-19 vaccines across UK, EU, and the US: fact-checking and the implications for future research.
34952647|a|While having access to safe and efficient vaccines is essential for eradicating the COVID-19 pandemic, gaining marketing authorisation is a critical step in enabling and speeding this process. On December 2, 2020, the United Kingdom became the first country to approve the first COVID-19 vaccine. This commentary aims to provide a quick overview of the UK's COVID-19 vaccine authorization process and compare it to that of the EU and the US. While the UK, EU, and US expedited the COVID-19 vaccine approval process, regulatory authorities did not appear to cut corners in their approval of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, as evidenced by their decisions to switch emergency use authorization to full authorization in the US and to renew conditional/temporary use authorization in the EU and UK, respectively. There is an opportunity to conduct a thorough investigation into and comparison of the filed dossiers, as well as the robustness of the evaluation process for the approval of COVID-19 vaccines.

One biological indicator with population >106 Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores was used to validate the HPV decontamination cycle as standard. HPV exposure resulted in complete virus inactivation in FVC (>= 5.03 log10 ) and API (>= 6.40 log10 ), showing HPV efficacy for reducing of chimpanzee adenovirus AZD1222 vaccine strain. However, the optimum concentration and contact time will vary depending on the type of application. Future decontamination studies scaling up the process to the recombinant COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing areas are necessary to evaluate if the HPV will have the same or better virucidal effectivity in each specific production area. In conclusion, HPV showed efficacy for reducing of AZD1222 chimpanzee adenovirus strain and can be a good choice for pharmaceutical industries facilities disinfection during recombinant COVID-19 vaccine production.

33468702|t|SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Variation in Space and Time in Hospitalized Patients in Philadelphia.
33468702|a|The severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the global outbreak of COVID-19. The epidemic accelerated in Philadelphia, PA, in the spring of 2020, with the city experiencing a first peak of infections on 15 April, followed by a decline through midsummer. Here, we investigate spread of the epidemic in the first wave in Philadelphia using full-genome sequencing of 52 SARS-CoV-2 samples obtained from 27 hospitalized patients collected between 30 March and 17 July 2020. Sequences most commonly resembled lineages circulating at earlier times in New York, suggesting transmission primarily from this location, though a minority of Philadelphia genomes matched sequences from other sites, suggesting additional introductions. Multiple genomes showed even closer matches to other Philadelphia isolates, suggestive of ongoing transmission within Philadelphia. We found that all of our isolates contained the D614G substitution in the viral spike and belong to lineages variously designated B.1, Nextstrain clade 20A or 20C, and GISAID clade G or GH. There were no viral sequence polymorphisms detectably associated with disease outcome. For some patients, genome sequences were determined longitudinally or concurrently from multiple body sites. In both cases, some comparisons showed reproducible polymorphisms, suggesting initial seeding with multiple variants and/or accumulation of polymorphisms after infection. These results thus provide data on the sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Philadelphia and begin to explore the dynamics within hospitalized patients.IMPORTANCE Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 spreads globally and within infected individuals is critical to the development of mitigation strategies. We found that most lineages in Philadelphia had resembled sequences from New York, suggesting infection primarily but not exclusively from this location. Many genomes had even nearer neighbors within Philadelphia, indicating local spread. Multiple genome sequences were available for some subjects and in a subset of cases could be shown to differ between time points and body sites within an individual, indicating heterogeneous viral populations within individuals and raising questions on the mechanisms responsible. There was no evidence that different lineages were associated with different outcomes in patients, emphasizing the importance of individual-specific vulnerability.

34953526|t|Final efficacy analysis, interim safety analysis, and immunogenicity of a single dose of recombinant novel coronavirus vaccine (adenovirus type 5 vector) in adults 18 years and older: an international, multicentre, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial.
34953526|a|BACKGROUND: The Ad5-nCoV vaccine is a single-dose adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vectored vaccine expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that was well-tolerated and immunogenic in phase 1 and 2 studies. In this study, we report results on the final efficacy and interim safety analyses of the phase 3 trial. METHODS: This double-blind, randomised, international, placebo-controlled, endpoint-case driven, phase 3, clinical trial enrolled adults aged 18 years older at study centres in Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Pakistan, and Russia. Participants were eligible for the study if they had no unstable or severe underlying medical or psychiatric conditions; had no history of a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection; were not pregnant or breastfeeding; and had no previous receipt of an adenovirus-vectored, coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. After informed consent was obtained, 25 mL of whole blood was withdrawn from all eligible participants who were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single intramuscular dose of 0 5 mL placebo or a 0 5 mL dose of 5 x 1010 viral particle (vp)/mL Ad5-nCoV vaccine; study staff and participants were blinded to treatment allocation. All participants were contacted weekly by email, telephone, or text message to self-report any symptoms of COVID-19 illness, and laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 was done for all participants with any symptoms. The primary efficacy objective evaluated Ad5-nCoV in preventing symptomatic, PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection occurring at least 28 days after vaccination in all participants who were at least 28 days postvaccination on Jan 15, 2021. The primary safety objective evaluated the incidence of any serious adverse events or medically attended adverse events postvaccination in all participants who received a study injection. This trial is closed for enrolment and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04526990). FINDINGS: Study enrolment began on Sept 22, 2020, in Pakistan, Nov 6, 2020, in Mexico, Dec 2, 2020, in Russia and Chile, and Dec 17, 2020, in Argentina; 150 endpoint cases were reached on Jan 15, 2021, triggering the final primary efficacy analysis. One dose of Ad5-nCoV showed a 57 5% (95% CI 39 7-70 0, p=0 0026) efficacy against symptomatic, PCR-confirmed, COVID-19 infection at 28 days or more postvaccination (21 250 participants; 45 days median duration of follow-up [IQR 36-58]). In the primary safety analysis undertaken at the time of the efficacy analysis (36 717 participants), there was no significant difference in the incidence of serious adverse events (14 [0 1%] of 18 363 Ad5-nCoV recipients and 10 [0 1%] of 18 354 placebo recipients, p=0 54) or medically attended adverse events (442 [2 4%] of 18 363 Ad5-nCoV recipients and 411 [2 2%] of 18 354 placebo recipients, p=0 30) between the Ad5-nCoV or placebo groups, or any serious adverse events considered related to the study product (none in both Ad5-nCoV and placebo recipients). In the extended safety cohort, 1004 (63 5%) of 1582 of Ad5-nCoV recipients and 729 (46 4%) of 1572 placebo recipients reported a solicited systemic adverse event (p<0 0001), of which headache was the most common (699 [44%] of Ad5-nCoV recipients and 481 [30 6%] of placebo recipients; p<0 0001). 971 (61 3%) of 1584 Ad5-nCoV recipients and 314 (20 0%) of 1573 placebo recipients reported an injection-site adverse event (p<0 0001), of which pain at the injection site was the most frequent; reported by 939 (59%) Ad5-nCoV recipients and 303 (19%) placebo recipients. INTERPRETATION: One dose of Ad5-nCoV is efficacious and safe in healthy adults aged 18 years and older. FUNDING: CanSino Biologics and the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology.

34942632|t|SARS-CoV-2 infection in free-ranging white-tailed deer.
34942632|a|Humans have infected a wide range of animals with SARS-CoV-2 viruses1-5, but the establishment of a new natural animal reservoir has not been observed. Here, we document that free-ranging white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are highly susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus, are exposed to a range of viral diversity from humans, and are capable of sustaining transmission in nature. SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected by rRT-PCR in more than one-third (129/360, 35.8%) of nasal swabs obtained from Odocoileus virginianus in northeast Ohio (USA) during January-March 2021. Deer in 6 locations were infected with 3 SARS-CoV-2 lineages (B.1.2, B.1.582, B.1.596). The B.1.2 viruses, dominant in humans in Ohio at the time, infected deer in four locations. Probable deer-to-deer transmission of B.1.2, B.1.582, and B.1.596 viruses was observed, allowing the virus to acquire amino acid substitutions in the spike protein (including the receptor-binding domain) and ORF1 that are infrequently seen in humans. No spillback to humans was observed, but these findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 viruses have the capacity to transmit in US wildlife, potentially opening new pathways for evolution. There is an urgent need to establish comprehensive "One Health" programs to monitor deer, the environment, and other wildlife hosts globally.

34967005|t|Guillain-Barre syndrome following COVID-19 vaccines: A scoping review.
34967005|a|Guillain-Barre syndrome following COVID-19 vaccines (GBSfCV19v) is a reported adverse effect that remains unclear. We present a structured review based on two case reports of GBSfCV19v, a systematic review, and Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) analysis to estimate the risk and describe the clinical characteristics (CC) of these events. We've searched on MEDLINE and Embase, from the inception to May 20, 2021, using the keywords: "Guillain barre syndrome" and cross-referenced with "covid-19 vaccines." We estimated the risk of GBSfCV19v, comparing it with the risk of GBS following the influenza vaccine (GBSfIv), considering the VAERS sensitivity. The clinical characteristics included: age, sex, comorbidities, type of vaccine, administered dose, clinical onset, deaths, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and electromyography (EMG) pattern. We found 43 cases, considering the risk of GBSfCV19v lower than GBSfIv (160-320 cases). The patients had a mean age of 54 years and 23 (56%) were male. The types of vaccines used: Pfizer (22), Moderna (9), AstraZeneca (3), Janssen (3), and Johnson & Johnson (1). 24 cases of GBS occurred after the first dose, with clinical onset of 7 days. CSF albuminocytological dissociation was reported in 7 patients, and EMG revealed a predominant demyelinating pattern. GBSfCV19v risk appears to be lower than what was expected from other respiratory virus vaccines. Most cases of GBS were middle-aged males within a week following the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, showing a typical demyelinating neuropathy with albuminocytological dissociation.

34981371|t|PPE pollution in the terrestrial and aquatic environment of the Chittagong city area associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and concomitant health implications.
34981371|a|The present study focuses on the indiscriminate disposal of personal protective equipment (PPEs) and resulting environmental contamination during the 3rd wave of COVID-19-driven global pandemic in the Chittagong metropolitan area, Bangladesh. Because of the very high rate of infection by the delta variant of this virus, the use of PPEs by the public is increased significantly to protect the ingestion/inhalation of respiratory droplets in the air. However, it is a matter of solicitude that general people throw away the PPEs to the dwelling environment unconsciously. With the increase of inappropriate disposal of PPEs (i.e., mostly the disposable face masks made from plastic microfibers), the possibility of transmission of the virus to the general public cannot be neglected completely. This is because this virus can survive for several days on the inanimate matter like plastics and fibers. At the same time, the result of environmental contamination by microplastic/microfiber has been widespread which eventually creates the worst impact on ecosystems and organisms. The present results may help to increase public perception of the use and subsequent disposal of PPEs, especially the face masks.

34952732|t|[Effectiveness of BNT162b2 vaccine to preventing COVID-19 in healthcare personnel].
34952732|a|OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 (BNT162b2) in healthcare personnel of a health department. METHOD: Test-negative casecontrol study. Healthcare personnel with suspected COVID-19 and healthcare personnel close contacts of COVID-19 cases were included between January 27th and June 6th, 2021. They were PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2; those with positive PCR were considered cases and those with negative PCR were considered controls. The adjusted vaccine effectiveness (aVE) to prevent COVID-19 cases and their 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated using the formula VE=(1-odds ratio)x100. RESULTS: 624 healthcare personnel were included, of which 43 (6.9%) were considered cases and 581 (93.8%) controls. The aVE of the complete regimen was 96.3% (95%CI: 82.599.2). The aVE of the incomplete pattern was 68.0% (95%CI: 30.085.4). CONCLUSIONS: The administration of the complete pattern of BNT162b2 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is effective for the prevention of cases of COVID-19 in healthcare personnel.

34969960|t|A rapid and affordable point of care test for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 based on hemagglutination and artificial intelligence interpretation.
34969960|a|Diagnostic tests that detect antibodies (AB) against SARS-CoV-2 for evaluation of seroprevalence and guidance of health care measures are important tools for managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Current tests have certain limitations with regard to turnaround time, costs and availability, particularly in point-of-care (POC) settings. We established a hemagglutination-based AB test that is based on bi-specific proteins which contain a dromedary-derived antibody (nanobody) binding red blood cells (RBD) and a SARS-CoV-2-derived antigen, such as the receptor-binding domain of the Spike protein (Spike-RBD). While the nanobody mediates swift binding to RBC, the antigen moiety directs instantaneous, visually apparent hemagglutination in the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific AB generated in COVID-19 patients or vaccinated individuals. Method comparison studies with assays cleared by emergency use authorization demonstrate high specificity and sensitivity. To further increase objectivity of test interpretation, we developed an image analysis tool based on digital image acquisition (via a cell phone) and a machine learning algorithm based on defined sample-training and -validation datasets. Preliminary data, including a small clinical study, provides proof of principle for test performance in a POC setting. Together, the data support the interpretation that this AB test format, which we refer to as 'NanoSpot.ai', is suitable for POC testing, can be manufactured at very low costs and, based on its generic mode of action, can likely be adapted to a variety of other pathogens.

34953513|t|Strong humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 Spike after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination with a 16-week interval between doses.
34953513|a|The standard regimen of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 includes two doses administered three weeks apart. However, some public health authorities spaced these doses, raising questions about efficacy. We analyzed longitudinal humoral responses against the D614G strain and variants of concern for SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of SARS-CoV-2-naive and previously infected individuals who received the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine with sixteen weeks between doses. While administering a second dose to previously infected individuals did not significantly improve humoral responses, these responses significantly increased in naive individuals after a 16-week spaced second dose, achieving similar levels as in previously infected individuals. Comparing these responses to those elicited in individuals receiving a short (4-week) dose interval showed that a 16-week interval induced more robust responses among naive vaccinees. These findings suggest that a longer interval between vaccine doses does not compromise efficacy and may allow greater flexibility in vaccine administration.

34942445|t|Nasal prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection by intranasal influenza-based boost vaccination in mouse models.
34942445|a|BACKGROUND: Vaccines in emergency use are efficacious against COVID-19, yet vaccine-induced prevention against nasal SARS-CoV-2 infection remains suboptimal. METHODS: Since mucosal immunity is critical for nasal prevention, we investigated the efficacy of an intramuscular PD1-based receptor-binding domain (RBD) DNA vaccine (PD1-RBD-DNA) and intranasal live attenuated influenza-based vaccines (LAIV-CA4-RBD and LAIV-HK68-RBD) against SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: Substantially higher systemic and mucosal immune responses, including bronchoalveolar lavage IgA/IgG and lung polyfunctional memory CD8 T cells, were induced by the heterologous PD1-RBD-DNA/LAIV-HK68-RBD as compared with other regimens. When vaccinated animals were challenged at the memory phase, prevention of robust SARS-CoV-2 infection in nasal turbinate was achieved primarily by the heterologous regimen besides consistent protection in lungs. The regimen-induced antibodies cross-neutralized variants of concerns. Furthermore, LAIV-CA4-RBD could boost the BioNTech vaccine for improved mucosal immunity. INTERPRETATION: Our results demonstrated that intranasal influenza-based boost vaccination induces mucosal and systemic immunity for effective SARS-CoV-2 prevention in both upper and lower respiratory systems.

34920343|t|Severe aplastic anemia after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination: Causality or coincidence?
34920343|a|The development of various autoimmune diseases has been reported after COVID-19 infections or vaccinations. However, no method for assessing the relationships between vaccines and the development of autoimmune diseases has been established. Aplastic anemia (AA) is an immune-mediated bone marrow failure syndrome. We report a case of severe AA that arose after the administration of a COVID-19 vaccine (the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine), which was treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In this patient, antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were detected both before and after the HSCT. After the patient's hematopoietic stem cells were replaced through HSCT, his AA improved despite the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In this case, antibodies derived from the COVID-19 vaccine may not have been directly involved in the development of AA. This case suggests that the measurement of vaccine antibody titers before and after allogeneic HSCT may provide clues to the pathogenesis of vaccine-related autoimmune diseases. Although causality was not proven in this case, further evaluations are warranted to assess the associations between vaccines and AA.

34982290|t|Ocular inflammatory events following COVID-19 vaccination: a multinational case series.
34982290|a|BACKGROUND: Inflammatory adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination are being reported amidst the growing concerns regarding vaccine's immunogenicity and safety, especially in patients with pre-existing inflammatory conditions. METHODS: Multinational case series of patients diagnosed with an ocular inflammatory event within 14 days following COVID-19 vaccination collected from 40 centres over a 3 month period in 2021. RESULTS: Seventy patients presented with ocular inflammatory events within 14 days following COVID-19 vaccination. The mean age was 51 years (range, 19-84 years). The most common events were anterior uveitis (n = 41, 58.6%), followed by posterior uveitis (n = 9, 12.9%) and scleritis (n = 7, 10.0%). The mean time to event was 5 days and 6 days (range, 1-14 days) after the first and second dose of vaccine, respectively. Among all patients, 36 (54.1%) had a previous history of ocular inflammatory event. Most patients (n = 48, 68.6%) were managed with topical corticosteroids. Final vision was not affected in 65 (92.9%), whereas 2 (2.9%) and 3 (4.3%) had reduction in visual acuity reduced by <=3 lines and > 3 lines, respectively. Reported complications included nummular corneal lesions (n = 1, 1.4%), cystoid macular oedema (n = 2, 2.9%) and macular scarring (n = 2, 2.9%). CONCLUSION: Ocular inflammatory events may occur after COVID-19 vaccination. The findings are based on a temporal association that does not prove causality. Even in the possibility of a causal association, most of the events were mild and had a good visual outcome.

34934810|t|Thyroiditis after Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA Vaccine: A Case Series.
34934810|a|Background: While SARS-COV-2 virus infection was reported to cause subacute thyroiditis, the mRNA vaccine for SARS-COV-2 was suspected to induce thyroiditis with thyrotoxicosis. Case Report: We describe three patients without a history of thyroid disease who presented with symptomatic, biochemical, and radiological evidence of thyroiditis with thyrotoxicosis, 10-20 days after receiving either the Pfizer Bio-NTech or the Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. All presented with thyrotoxicosis, but with negative thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins for Graves' disease and no autonomous nodules. Two patients underwent thyroid uptake and scan which confirmed thyroiditis. One patient had significantly increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6). All had improvement in symptoms with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), with one patient eventually requiring steroids for symptom control. Discussion: The mRNA vaccine for SARS-COV-2 was associated with thyroiditis and presented with thyrotoxicosis. Elevated proinflammatory markers and cytokines after vaccines may play a major role. Conclusion: Our case series report highlights a possible relationship between the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine and thyroiditis with thyrotoxicosis, which previously not recognized by health providers.

34957149|t|Inactivated COVID-19 Vaccine Induces a Low Humoral Immune Response in a Subset of Dermatological Patients Receiving Immunosuppressants.
34957149|a|Inactivated Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine (Sinovac Life Sciences, Beijing) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been used in many countries. However, its immunogenicity profile in immunosuppressed dermatological patients is lacking. This prospective observational case-control study compared the humoral immune response between adult dermatological patients receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapies (n = 14) and those who did not (n = 18); excluding patients with HIV infection, cancer, non-dermatological autoimmune conditions, previous COVID-19 infection, and positive anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG prior to vaccination. The subjects were advised to withhold methotrexate for 1 week after each vaccine dose while continuing other therapies unadjusted. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody, surrogate neutralizing antibody (sNAb), and seroconversion rates (calculated from the percentages of participants in the group with positive sNAb) were used to assess immunogenicity. We found that participants using azathioprine, cyclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil, or prednisolone >= 10 mg/day had a lower level of serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody and sNAb than those received methotrexate <= 10 mg/week, prednisolone < 10 mg/day, or biologics (i.e., secukinumab, ixekizumab, omalizumab). Patients who received methotrexate <= 10 mg/week, prednisolone < 10 mg/day or the biologics had a similar immunogenicity profile to those without immunosuppressive therapies. Despite the lack of statistical significance, a reduction of humoral immune response was observed among the study participants who used >=2 immunosuppressants or pemphigus patients. Our findings suggest that a subset of patients with immune-mediated skin conditions respond poorly to the vaccine despite having low-level immunosuppression. These patients could benefit from vaccines that trigger a greater level of immunogenicity or booster doses.

34987936|t|Epidemiology and Risk Factors of COVID-19-Related Mortality.
34987936|a|Introduction During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in India, several characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, based on demographics, mortality predictors, and presence of comorbidities, were found to be associated with poor outcomes. The objective of this study was to identify such epidemiological and clinical characteristics among the patients admitted at a tertiary-care center in India that may have predisposed them to COVID-19-related mortality. Methods This retrospective observational study conducted at the Department of Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, in May 2021 included 141 COVID-19 confirmed patients. The medical history, demographic characteristics, comorbidities, clinical findings, and laboratory data of each patient were obtained. The data were analyzed to identify significant clinical and laboratory parameters that led to the adverse final outcomes. Results Hypertension was the most common comorbidity and the presence of diabetes with hypertension led to poorer final outcomes. Lower oxygen saturation and requirement of oxygen supplementation at admission along with worse prognostic scores during admission led to poorer outcomes. Twenty-seven patients needed non-invasive ventilation (NIV) during the hospital course, and all ultimately landed up among the 56 patients who were managed on invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Multivariate logistic regression analysis performed identified COVID-19 severity at admission, co-existence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg, and serum creatinine greater than 1.2 mg/dL to be associated with higher COVID-19 mortality. Conclusion COVID-19 patients having the co-existence of diabetes and hypertension constitute a high-risk group and may be targeted by prompt vaccination strategies. The presence of severe disease along with a need for oxygen therapy and other intensive care interventions ultimately led to unfavorable outcomes.

34984442|t|COVID-19 mRNA vaccines delay the onset of breakthrough infections with less radiographic abnormalities.
34984442|a|This retrospective study of incoming travelers with COVID-19 showed that individuals immunized by mRNA vaccines had significantly longer post-vaccination interval (median: 30.5 days) to breakthrough infection, lower WBC and LDH on admission, and less radiographic abnormalities than those immunized by inactivated virus vaccine who paradoxically had lower respiratory viral load.

34984055|t|De Novo Immunoglobulin A Vasculitis Following Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 Immunization.
34984055|a|Background: Immunizations have been previously described as potential triggering events for the development of certain glomerular diseases. However, glomerular disease occurrences are being reported after exposure to a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine. Case Report: A 50-year-old male presented to a nephrology clinic for evaluation of persistent proteinuria. Six weeks prior to evaluation, the patient had reported developing a rash 2 weeks after receiving the first dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BNT162b2 mRNA, Pfizer, Inc). His primary care provider treated the rash with corticosteroids, leading to partial improvement of the skin lesions. Three weeks after the first vaccine injection, the patient received his scheduled second vaccine injection. Within 2 days, the rash reappeared. This time, the lesions were more severe in nature. Skin biopsy revealed immunoglobulin A (IgA)-dominant leukocytoclastic vasculitis. After the patient completed 2 weeks of oral corticosteroids, urinalysis revealed proteinuria, and consultation with nephrology was requested. On examination, healing papules were noted on his legs. Serum creatinine 2 weeks after the second dose of vaccine was 0.9 mg/dL. Microscopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed acanthocytes. Urine protein to creatinine ratio 3 weeks after the second dose of vaccine was 1.1 g/day. Serum complements were normal, and all pertinent serology was negative. Kidney biopsy findings were consistent with IgA nephropathy. Conclusion: The clinical presentation and pathologic findings in this case strongly suggest that the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 vaccine can trigger a clinical syndrome compatible with Henoch-Schonlein purpura. The recurrence of the rash following the second dose argues for a definite causal association by the Naranjo criteria.

35614113|t|Ultrasensitive detection of salivary SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in individuals with natural and COVID-19 vaccine-induced immunity.
35614113|a|We assessed the feasibility of a highly sensitive immunoassay method based on single molecule array (Simoa) technology to detect IgG and IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) in saliva from individuals with natural or vaccine-induced COVID-19 immunity. The performance of the method was compared to a laboratory-developed SARS-CoV-2 RBD total antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Paired serum and saliva specimens were collected from individuals (n = 40) prior to and 2 weeks after receiving an initial prime COVID-19 vaccine dose (Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 or Moderna mRNA-1273). Saliva was collected using a commercially available collection device (OraSure Inc.) and SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG antibodies were measured by an indirect ELISA using concentrated saliva samples and a Simoa immunoassay using unconcentrated saliva samples. The IgG results were compared with paired serum specimens that were analyzed for total RBD antibodies using the ELISA method. The analytical sensitivity of the saliva-based Simoa immunoassay was five orders of magnitude higher than the ELISA assay: 0.24 pg/mL compared to 15 ng/mL. The diagnostic sensitivity of the saliva ELISA method was 90% (95% CI 76.3-97.2%) compared to 91.7% (95% CI 77.5-98.2%) for the Simoa immunoassay without total IgG-normalization and 100% (95% CI 90.3-100%) for the Simoa immunoassay after total IgG-normalization when compared to the serum ELISA assay. When analyzed using the SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG antibody ELISA, the average relative increase in antibody index (AI) between the saliva of the post- and pre-vaccinated individuals was 8.7 (AIpost/pre). An average relative increase of 431 pg/mL was observed when the unconcentrated saliva specimens were analyzed using the Simoa immunoassay (SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgGpost/pre). These findings support the suitability of concentrated saliva specimens for the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG antibodies via ELISA, and unconcentrated saliva specimens for the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG and IgA using an ultrasensitive Simoa immunoassay.

35617826|t|Heterologous ChAdOx1/BNT162b2 vaccination induces stronger immune response than homologous ChAdOx1 vaccination: The pragmatic, multi-center, three-arm, partially randomized HEVACC trial.
35617826|a|BACKGROUND: Several COVID-19 vaccines have been approved. The mRNA vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech (Comirnaty, BNT162b2; BNT) and the vector vaccine from AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria, ChAdOx1; AZ) have been widely used. mRNA vaccines induce high antibody and T cell responses, also to SARS-CoV-2 variants, but are costlier and less stable than the slightly less effective vector vaccines. For vector vaccines, heterologous vaccination schedules have generally proven more effective than homologous schedules. METHODS: In the HEVACC three-arm, single-blinded, adaptive design study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04907331), participants between 18 and 65 years with no prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and a first dose of AZ or BNT were included. The AZ/AZ and the AZ/BNT arms were randomized (in a 1:1 ratio stratified by sex and trial site) and single-blinded, the third arm (BNT/BNT) was observational. We compared the reactogenicity between the study arms and hypothesized that immunogenicity was higher for the heterologous AZ/BNT compared to the homologous AZ/AZ regimen using neutralizing antibody titers as primary endpoint. FINDINGS: This interim analysis was conducted after 234 participants had been randomized and 254 immunized (N=109 AZ/AZ, N=115 AZ/BNZ, N=30 BNT/BNT). Heterologous AZ/BNT vaccination was well tolerated without study-related severe adverse events. Neutralizing antibody titers on day 30 were statistically significant higher in the AZ/BNT and the BNT/BNT groups than in the AZ/AZ group, for B.1.617.2 (Delta) AZ/AZ median reciprocal titer 75.9 (99.9% CI 58.0 - 132.5), AZ/BNT 571.5 (99.9% CI 396.6 - 733.1), and BNT/BNT 404.5 (99.9% CI 68.3 - 1024). Similarly, the frequency and multifunctionality of spike-specific T cell responses was comparable between the AZ/BNT and the BNT/BNT groups, but lower in the AZ/AZ vaccinees. INTERPRETATION: This study clearly shows the immunogenicity and safety of heterologous AZ/BNT vaccination and encourages further studies on heterologous vaccination schedules. FUNDING: This work was supported by the Medical University of Innsbruck, and partially funded by NIAID contracts No. 75N9301900065, 75N93021C00016, and 75N93019C00051.

34987092|t|Immunogenicity of BNT162b2 mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in patients with psoriatic arthritis on TNF inhibitors.
34987092|a|BACKGROUND: Scanty data on the immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 vaccine in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) on Tumor Necrosis Factor inhibitors (TNFi) have been published. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the humoral response to BNT162b2 vaccination patients with PsA on TNFi, comparing immunogenicity with healthy controls. METHODS: Forty patients with classified PsA on TNFi undergoing vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BioNTech/Pfizer) were enrolled. Fifteen days after the second shot, serum IgG levels against SARS-CoV-2 (Abbott ARCHITECT i2000SR, positivity cut-off 50 AU/mL) were assayed in all patients. Clinimetrics and treatment data were gathered. TNFi treatment was not discontinued throughout the whole period, whereas methotrexate (MTX) was discontinued for 1 week after each shot in those on combination therapy. Sera from healthcare professionals were considered as healthy controls for 1:1 propensity score matching; any of them was taking medication.Student's t-test and logistic regression were used for investigating differences in immunogenicity between groups and predictors of antibody response. RESULTS: Clinical Disease Activity Index did not change before and after vaccination (7.06+-5.23 to 7.10+-5.27, p=0.92).Patients with PsA achieved a positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG level with a mean (+-SD) of 13794.44+-15 815.42 AU/mL. Although lower, the antibody level was not significantly different from matched controls (19227.4+-11.8460.45 AU/mL, p=0.08). In the overall sample, those on MTX (12/80, 15%) had a trend toward lower immune response (p=0.07); glucocorticoid therapy (11/80, 13.8%) predicted lower antibody levels (p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Continuing TNFi in patients with PsA throughout the vaccination did not hamper immunogenicity.

34969322|t|Ethical Principles in Personal Protective Equipment Inventory Management Decisions and Partnerships Across State Lines During the COVID-19 Pandemic.
34969322|a|The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented strain on the personal protective equipment (PPE) supply chain. Given the dearth of PPE and consequences for transmission, GetMePPE Chicago (GMPC) developed a PPE allocation framework and system, distributing 886 900 units to 274 institutions from March 2020 to July 2021 to address PPE needs. As the pandemic evolved, GMPC made difficult decisions about (1) building reserve inventory (to balance present and future, potentially higher clinical acuity, needs), (2) donating to other states/out-of-state organizations, and (3) receiving donations from other states. In this case study, we detail both GMPC's experience in making these decisions and the ethical frameworks that guided these decisions. We also reflect on lessons learned and suggest which values may have been in conflict (eg, maximizing benefits vs duty to mission, defined in the context of PPE allocation) in each circumstance, which values were prioritized, and when that prioritization would change. Such guidance can promote a values-based approach to key issues concerning distribution of PPE and other scarce medical resources in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and related future pandemics.

33583326|t|Structural genetics of circulating variants affecting the SARS-CoV-2 spike/human ACE2 complex.
33583326|a|SARS-CoV-2 entry in human cells is mediated by the interaction between the viral Spike protein and the human ACE2 receptor. This mechanism evolved from the ancestor bat coronavirus and is currently one of the main targets for antiviral strategies. However, there currently exist several Spike protein variants in the SARS-CoV-2 population as the result of mutations, and it is unclear if these variants may exert a specific effect on the affinity with ACE2 which, in turn, is also characterized by multiple alleles in the human population. In the current study, the GBPM analysis, originally developed for highlighting host-guest interaction features, has been applied to define the key amino acids responsible for the Spike/ACE2 molecular recognition, using four different crystallographic structures. Then, we intersected these structural results with the current mutational status, based on more than 295,000 sequenced cases, in the SARS-CoV-2 population. We identified several Spike mutations interacting with ACE2 and mutated in at least 20 distinct patients: S477N, N439K, N501Y, Y453F, E484K, K417N, S477I and G476S. Among these, mutation N501Y in particular is one of the events characterizing SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, which has recently risen in frequency in Europe. We also identified five ACE2 rare variants that may affect interaction with Spike and susceptibility to infection: S19P, E37K, M82I, E329G and G352V.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

34960209|t|Local and Systemic Adverse Reactions to mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Comparing Two Vaccine Types and Occurrence of Previous COVID-19 Infection.
34960209|a|The aim of this study was to assess adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines, comparing the BNT162b2 or the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines and the presence and seriousness of a previous COVID-19 infection. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of vaccinated healthcare workers at a tertiary hospital in Barcelona (Spain). Thirty-eight percent of vaccine recipients responded to the questionnaire. We compared the prevalence of adverse reactions by vaccine type and history of COVID-19 infections. A total of 2373 respondents had received the BNT162b2 vaccine, and 506 the mRNA-1273 vaccine. The prevalence of at least one adverse reaction with doses 1 and 2 was 41% and 70%, respectively, in the BNT162b2 group, and 60% and 92% in the mRNA-1273 group (p < 0.001). The BNT162b2 group reported less prevalence of all adverse reactions. Need for medical leave was significantly more frequent among the mRNA-1273 group (12% versus 4.6% p < 0.001). Interestingly, respondents with a history of allergies or chronic illnesses did not report more adverse reactions. The frequency of adverse reactions with dose 2 was 96% (95% CI 88-100%) for those with a history of COVID-19 related hospitalization, and 86% (95% CI 83-89%) for those with mild or moderate symptomatic COVID-19, significantly higher than for participants with no history of COVID-19 infections (67%, 95% CI 65-69%). Our results could help inform vaccine recipients of the probability of their having adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines.

33335323|t|T cell and antibody responses induced by a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine in a phase 1/2 clinical trial.
33335323|a|Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has caused a global pandemic, and safe, effective vaccines are urgently needed1. Strong, Th1-skewed T cell responses can drive protective humoral and cell-mediated immune responses2 and might reduce the potential for disease enhancement3. Cytotoxic T cells clear virus-infected host cells and contribute to control of infection4. Studies of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have suggested a protective role for both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in recovery from COVID-19 (refs. 5,6). ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) is a candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine comprising a replication-deficient simian adenovirus expressing full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We recently reported preliminary safety and immunogenicity data from a phase 1/2 trial of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (NCT04400838)7 given as either a one- or two-dose regimen. The vaccine was tolerated, with induction of neutralizing antibodies and antigen-specific T cells against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Here we describe, in detail, exploratory analyses of the immune responses in adults, aged 18-55 years, up to 8 weeks after vaccination with a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in this trial, demonstrating an induction of a Th1-biased response characterized by interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha cytokine secretion by CD4+ T cells and antibody production predominantly of IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses. CD8+ T cells, of monofunctional, polyfunctional and cytotoxic phenotypes, were also induced. Taken together, these results suggest a favorable immune profile induced by ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, supporting the progression of this vaccine candidate to ongoing phase 2/3 trials to assess vaccine efficacy.

33390829|t|Current advances in the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
33390829|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is now a global pandemic that has wreaked havoc globally, which has put a heavy toll on public health, lives, and the world economy. Vaccination is considered as one of the greatest successes in medical history. Based on prior experience with the development of SARS-CoV vaccines, all COVID-19 vaccines must be subjected to the tests for protective effects and harmful risks derived from antibody-dependent enhancement that may contribute to augmented infectivity and/or eosinophilic infiltration. The SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is now being developed urgently in several different ways. China is regarded as one of the world's leading countries in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, up to date the last inactivated vaccine international clinical (Phase III) trial was launched in the United Arab Emirates by Sinopharm China National Biotec Group (CNBG). In this review, we outline the current status of vaccine development against clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 strains, anticipating that such attempts would help create efficacious and sage SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

33359061|t|Molecular epidemiology of COVID-19 in Oman: A molecular and surveillance study for the early transmission of COVID-19 in the country.
33359061|a|BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been proven to be lethal to human health, which affects almost every corner of the world. The objectives of this study were to add context to the global data and international genomic consortiums, and to give insight into the efficiency of the contact tracing system in Oman. METHODS: We combined epidemiological data and whole-genome sequence data from 94 samples of SARS-CoV-2 in Oman to understand the origins, genetic variation, and transmissibility. The whole-genome size of sequence data was obtained through a customized SARS-COV-2 research panel. Amplifier methods ranged from 26 Kbp to 30 Kbp and were submitted to GISAID. FINDINGS: The study found that P323L (94.7%) is the most common mutation, followed by D614G (92.6%) Spike protein mutation. A unique mutation, I280V, was first reported in Oman and was associated with a rare lineage, B.1.113 (10.6%). In addition, the study revealed a good agreement between genetic and epidemiological data. INTERPRETATION: Oman's robust surveillance system was very efficient in guiding the outbreak investigation processes in the country, the study illustrates the future importance of molecular epidemiology in leading the national response to outbreaks and pandemics.

34971694|t|Evolution of drug delivery systems: From 1950 to 2020 and beyond.
34971694|a|Modern drug delivery technology began in 1952 with the advent of the Spansule  sustained-release capsule technology, which can deliver a drug for 12 h after oral administration through an initial immediate dose followed by the remaining released gradually. Until the 1980s, oral and transdermal formulations providing therapeutic durations up to 24 h for small molecules dominated the drug delivery field and the market. The introduction of Lupron Depot  in 1989 opened the door for long-acting injectables and implantables, extending the drug delivery duration from days to months and occasionally years. Notably, the new technologies allowed long-term delivery of peptide and protein drugs, although limited to parenteral administration. The introduction of the first PEGylated protein, Adagen , in 1990 marked the new era of PEGylation, resulting in Doxil  (doxorubicin in PEGylated liposome) in 1995, Movantik (PEGylated naloxone - naloxegol) in 2014, and Onpattro  (Patisiran - siRNA in PEGylated lipid nanoparticle) in 2018. Drug-polymer complexes were introduced, e.g., InFed  (iron-dextran complex injection) in 1974 and Abraxane  (paclitaxel-albumin complex) in 2005. In 2000, both Mylotarg  (antibody-drug conjugate - gemtuzumab ozogamicin) and Rapamune  (sirolimus nanocrystal formulation) were introduced. The year 2000 also marked the launching of the National Nanotechnology Initiative by the U.S. government, which was soon followed by the rest of the world. Extensive work on nanomedicine, particularly formulations designed to escape from endosomes after being taken by tumor cells, along with PEGylation technology, ultimately resulted in the timely development of lipid nanoparticle formulations for COVID-19 vaccine delivery in 2020. While the advances in drug delivery technologies for the last seven decades are breathtaking, they are only the tip of an iceberg of technologies that have yet to be utilized in an approved formulation or even to be discovered. As life expectancy continues to increase, more people require long-term care for various diseases. Filling the current and future unmet needs requires innovative drug delivery technologies to overcome age-old familiar hurdles, e.g., improving water-solubility of poorly soluble drugs, overcoming biological barriers, and developing more efficient long-acting depot formulations. The lessons learned from the past are essential assets for developing future drug delivery technologies implemented into products. As the development of COVID-19 vaccines demonstrated, meeting the unforeseen crisis of the uncertain future requires continuous cumulation of failures, knowledge, and technologies. Conscious efforts of supporting diversified research topics in the drug delivery field are urgently needed more than ever.

33486146|t|Unilateral axillary Adenopathy in the setting of COVID-19 vaccine.
33486146|a|With the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approval and rollout of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, it is important for radiologists to consider recent COVID-19 vaccination history as a possible differential diagnosis for patients with unilateral axillary adenopathy. Hyperplastic axillary nodes can be seen on sonography after any vaccination but are more common after a vaccine that evokes a strong immune response, such as the COVID-19 vaccine. As the differential of unilateral axillary adenopathy includes breast malignancy, it is crucial to both thoroughly evaluate the breast for primary malignancy and to elicit history of recent vaccination. As COVID-19 vaccines will soon be available to a larger patient population, radiologists should be familiar with the imaging features of COVID-19 vaccine induced hyperplastic adenopathy and its inclusion in a differential for unilateral axillary adenopathy. Short-term follow-up for unilateral axillary adenopathy in the setting of recent COVID-19 vaccination is an appropriate recommendation, in lieu of immediately performing potentially unnecessary and costly axillary lymph node biopsies.

35632499|t|Increased Receptor Affinity and Reduced Recognition by Specific Antibodies Contribute to Immune Escape of SARS-CoV-2 Variant Omicron.
35632499|a|In this report, we mechanistically reveal how the Variant of Concern (VOC) SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) escapes neutralizing antibody responses, by physio-chemical characterization of this variant in comparison to the wild-type Wuhan and the Delta variant (B.1.617.2). Convalescent sera, as well as sera obtained from participants who received two or three doses of mRNA vaccines (Moderna-mRNA-1273  or Pfizer-BNT162b2 ), were used for comparison in this study. Our data demonstrate that both Delta, as well as Omicron variants, exhibit a higher affinity for the receptor ACE2, facilitating infection and causing antibody escape by receptor affinity (affinity escape), due to the reduced ability of antibodies to compete with RBD-receptor interaction and virus neutralization. In contrast, only Omicron but not the Delta variant escaped antibody recognition, most likely because only Omicron exhibits the mutation at E484A, a position associated with reduced recognition, resulting in further reduced neutralization (specificity escape). Nevertheless, the immunizations with RNA-based vaccines resulted in marked viral neutralization in vitro for all strains, compatible with the fact that Omicron is still largely susceptible to vaccination-induced antibodies, despite affinity- and specificity escape.

34980975|t|Cardiogenic shock revealing myocarditis after mRNA vaccination against covid-19: Case report and brief review for the first case in Morocco.
34980975|a|Introduction: and importance: After its unexpected effectiveness in the clinical trials, the anti-COVID-19 vaccine type mRNA was launched on December 11, 2020, but a few months later, several reports of post-mRNA vaccination myocarditis were published, but without any proven causal link. Case presentation: We report the case of a 14-year-old teenager admitted to the emergency department for a cardiogenic shock, the patient mentioned that he had an anti-COVID 19 vaccination 10 days before his admission. First, the vasoactive drugs had stabilized the patient; the troponins came back highly favorable but later confirmed myocarditis by magnetic resonance imaging. In this sense an etiological analysis was made and it came back without any particularities, leaving us relating the myocarditis to the vaccination. Clinical discussion: Post-vaccination myocarditis is a rare event, with very few reports in the literature. After the introduction of COVID vaccination, several reports were published, mostly after the mRNA vaccine. Until now, no causal link has been proven, so we need to have more reports in this sense to have a better knowledge of this phenomenon. Conclusion: Until we obtain a more precise explanation of the mechanism of myocarditis after vaccination with the anti-COVID-19 vaccine, all symptoms suggesting myocarditis should be systematically monitored during the first 7 days after vaccination.

33361645|t|Comparison of the immunogenicity & protective efficacy of various SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates in non-human primates.
33361645|a|Background & objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a global public health crisis and research groups worldwide are engaged in developing vaccine candidates to curb its transmission, with a few vaccines having progressed to advanced stages of clinical trials. The aim of this systematic review was to compare immunogenicity and protective efficacy of various SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates tested in non-human primate (NHP) models. Methods: Literature on effect of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in NHP models reported on PubMed and preprint platforms (medRxiv and bioRxiv) till October 22, 2020, was searched with the following terms: coronavirus vaccine, COVID-19 vaccine, SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, nonhuman primate, and rhesus macaque. Results: Our search yielded 19 studies, which reported immune response elicited by 18 vaccine candidates in NHP. All the vaccines induced detectable neutralizing antibody (NAb) titres in the serum of vaccinated animals, with some showing effective viral clearance from various organs. The vaccinated animals also showed nil to mild histopathological changes in their lungs compared to placebo groups in the trials that performed necropsy. Interpretation & conclusions: Our findings highlighted onset of quick immunogenicity and protective efficacy of mRNA-1273, followed by Ad26.CoV2.S, NVX-CoV2373, BNT162b2, RBD and BBV152 vaccine candidates in preclinical trials as compared to the others. NHP data also showed correlation with clinical trial data available for a few vaccines. Preclinical trials of COVID-19 vaccine candidates in NHPs yielded promising results, with some candidates faring better than others.

34915086|t|Use of Sanger protocols to identify variants of concern, key mutations and track evolution of SARS-CoV-2.
34915086|a|Vaccination and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants mark the second year of the pandemic. Variants have amino acid mutations at the spike region, a viral protein central in the understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis and vaccine response. Variants may dominate local epidemics, as Gamma (P.1) in Brazil, emerging in 2020 and prevailing until mid-2021. Different obstacles hinder a wider use of Next-Generation Sequencing for genomic surveillance. We describe Sanger based sequencing protocols: i) Semi-nested RT-PCR covering up to 3.684 kb (>96 %) spike gene; ii) One-Step RT-PCR for key Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) mutations (codons 417-501); iii) One-Step RT-PCR of partial N region to improve genomic capability. Protocols use leftovers of RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs for quantitative RT-PCR diagnosis; with retro-transcribed DNA sequenced at ABI 3500 using dye termination chemistry. Analyses of sequences from 95 individuals (late 2020/early 2021) identified extensive amino acid variation, 57 % with at least one key mutation at the Receptor Binding Domain, with B.1.1.28 lineage most prevalent, followed by Gamma and Zeta variants, with no Delta variant observed. The relatively low cost and simplicity may provide an accessible tool to improve surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, monitor new variants and vaccinated breakthroughs.

35632563|t|Omicron Infection Evokes Cross-Protection against SARS-CoV-2 Variants in Vaccinees.
35632563|a|Due to the rapid global spread of the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant, efforts to scale up COVID-19 booster vaccination have been improved, especially in light of the increasing evidence of reduced neutralizing antibody (NT Ab) over time in vaccinated subjects. In this study, neutralizing antibody responses against the Wild-Type, Delta, and Omicron strains were evaluated among vaccinees, both infected with Omicron or uninfected, and non-vaccinated subjects infected with Omicron. The aim of the study was to compare the cross-protective humoral response to the variant strains induced by vaccination and/or Omicron infection. The results showed a significant difference in the neutralizing antibody response between the vaccinees and the Omicron-infected vaccinated subjects against the three tested strains (p < 0.001), confirming the booster effect of the Omicron infection in the vaccinees. By contrast, Omicron infection only did not enhance the antibody response to the other variants, indicating a lack of cross-protection. These results suggest the importance of updating the current formulation of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to protect people against the Omicron subvariants. A specific Omicron vaccine, administered as a booster for the previously adopted mRNA vaccines, may protect against a wider range of SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, it is unlikely that the Omicron vaccine alone would be able to protect non-vaccinated subjects against other circulating variants.

34916063|t|Vaccine-Induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia Due to Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccine From a Deceased Donor: A Case Report.
34916063|a|With the rapid and massive vaccination campaign against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) taking place across the globe, there are increasing reports of thrombotic complications with various COVID-19 vaccines such as the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA, Moderna mRNA, AstraZeneca Oxford (serum institute), and Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccines. We report a case of successful organ donation from an 18-year-old woman who presented with cerebral venous thrombosis caused by vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia following the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (AstraZeneca, University of Oxford, and Serum Institute of India), which caused brain death. Four recipients received 5 organs, kidneys (2), liver (1), and combined heart and lung (1). All 4 recipients had normal graft function without any thrombotic complications after 16 weeks of transplantation. This is first such case being reported from Asian countries.

34915073|t|SARS-CoV-2 vector and m-RNA based vaccines with respect to postvaccination infections among staff of a tertiary care hospital.
34915073|a|OBJECTIVES: The identification of SARS-CoV-2 antigen or RNA in respiratory specimens >=14 days after administration of all recommended doses of authorized COVID-19 vaccines is defined as "breakthrough infection". In the present investigation m-RNA and vector based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were analysed with respect to postvaccination infections in vaccinated hospital employees. METHODS: 8 553 staff members were vaccinated with BNT162b2 (47%) or ChAdOx1-S (53%) between January and May 2021. In a retrospective observational cohort study, incidence of SARS-CoV-2 postvaccination infections was analysed in relation to demographic data, viral load, virus variants, vaccine brand and vaccination status at time of positive PCR test ("fully vaccinated" (>=14 days since second dose), "partially vaccinated" (>21 days since first, but < 14 days after second dose), "insufficiently vaccinated" (<22 days since first dose)). RESULTS: Within the follow-up period, ending on July 31st, 2021, person-time at risk adjusted monthly rates for SARS-CoV-2 postvaccination infections were 0 18% (BNT162b2) and 0 57% (ChAdOx1-S) for insufficiently, 0 34% (BNT162b2) and 0 32% (ChAdOx1-S) for partially and 0 06% (BNT162b2) and 0 04% (ChAdOx1-S) for fully vaccinated participants. The two vaccine types did not differ with respect to hazard ratios for none of the respective postvaccination infection types. No cases of COVID-19 related hospitalizations or deaths were reported. Genotyping of positive PCR specimens revealed 42 variant of concerns: B.1.1.7 (Alpha variant; n=34); B.1.351 (Beta variant; n=2), B.1.617.2 (Delta variant; n=6). CONCLUSIONS: BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1-S are both effective in preventing breakthrough infections, however, it seems important, that all recommended vaccine doses are administered.

32778225|a|The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) threatens global public health. The development of a vaccine is urgently needed for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Here, we report the pilot-scale production of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate (BBIBP-CorV) that induces high levels of neutralizing antibodies titers in mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, and nonhuman primates (cynomolgus monkeys and rhesus macaques) to provide protection against SARS-CoV-2. Two-dose immunizations using 2 mug/dose of BBIBP-CorV provided highly efficient protection against SARS-CoV-2 intratracheal challenge in rhesus macaques, without detectable antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. In addition, BBIBP-CorV exhibits efficient productivity and good genetic stability for vaccine manufacture. These results support the further evaluation of BBIBP-CorV in a clinical trial.

34970254|t|A Recent Update on Advanced Molecular Diagnostic Techniques for COVID-19 Pandemic: An Overview.
34970254|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which started out as an outbreak of pneumonia, has now turned into a pandemic due to its rapid transmission. Besides developing a vaccine, rapid, accurate, and cost-effective diagnosis is essential for monitoring and combating the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its related variants on time with precision and accuracy. Currently, the gold standard for detection of SARS-CoV-2 is Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), but it lacks accuracy, is time-consuming and cumbersome, and fails to detect multi-variant forms of the virus. Herein, we have summarized conventional diagnostic methods such as Chest-CT (Computed Tomography), RT-PCR, Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP), Reverse Transcription-LAMP (RT-LAMP), as well new modern diagnostics such as CRISPR-Cas-based assays, Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS), Lateral Flow Assays (LFA), Graphene-Field Effect Transistor (GraFET), electrochemical sensors, immunosensors, antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs)-based assays, and microarrays for SARS-CoV-2 detection. This review will also provide an insight into an ongoing research and the possibility of developing more economical tools to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.

35619688|t|Biosafety in Dental Health Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Study.
35619688|a|Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had quite an impact on dental health care. Concerns about the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through contaminant fluids and droplet formation during several dental procedures highly impacted dental health care, drastically reducing the number of dental practices worldwide. To monitor SARS-CoV-2 contamination in dental clinics, a longitudinal study was carried out during the return of dental practice at university. Methods: Dental health care professionals [(DHCPs); teachers, undergraduate dental students, and dental assistants] and patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a dental school clinic environment from 11th January to 12th March 2021 (9 weeks). Serological testing was performed on DHCPs in two-time points. Additionally, samples with low Ct values were sequenced to identify the circulating SARS-CoV-2 variant and possible transmission clusters. Results: We found a low number of dental staff (5.8%), patients (0.9%), and environment sites (0.8%) positive for SARS-CoV-2. Most positive cases had asymptomatic to mild symptoms, and two asymptomatic DHCPs presented prolonged infection. In the first week after previous exposure to COVID-19, 16.2% of DHCPs had IgM or IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and 1/3 of them had undetected antibodies in the last weeks. The variant zeta (P.2) could be detected. No cross-infection was observed between participants. Conclusion: Our study suggests that dental practice can be safely executed when adequate control measures and biosafety protocols are applied. DHCP and patient testing, patient telemonitoring, proper use of personal protection equipment, and sanitization of surfaces are essential to avoid SARS-CoV-2 cross-infection in dental practice.

34981433|a|We investigated the efficacy of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in patients with B-cell malignancies treated with anti-CD20 antibody. Although T-cell-mediated immune responses were detected even in patients receiving R-CHOP treatment, the S1 antibody titer following BNT162b2 vaccination remained only marginally increased for more than 3 years after the final dose of anti-CD20 antibody. We found no relationship between the percent of B-cells and S1 antibody titer. The duration of this suppression was much longer than we anticipated. Further protection and treatment strategies against COVID-19 for these patients are warranted.

34975177|t|Synthesis and investigation of anti-COVID19 ability of ferrocene Schiff base derivatives by quantum chemical and molecular docking.
34975177|a|The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has rampaged the world with more than 236 million confirmed cases and over 4.8 million deaths across the world reported by the world health organization (WHO) till Oct 5, 2021. Due to the advent of different variants of coronavirus, there is an urgent need to identify effective drugs and vaccines to combat rapidly spreading virus varieties across the globe. Ferrocene derivatives have attained immense interest as anticancer, antifungal, antibacterial, and antiparasitic drug candidates. However, the ability of ferrocene as anti-COVID-19 is not yet explored. Therefore, in the present work, we have synthesized four new ferrocene Schiff bases (L1-L4) to understand the active sites and biological activity of ferrocene derivatives by employing various molecular descriptors, frontier molecular orbitals (FMO), electron affinity, ionization potential, and molecular electrostatic potential (MEP). A theoretical insight on synthesized ferrocene Schiff bases was accomplished by molecular docking, frontier molecular orbitals energies, active sites, and molecular descriptors which were further compared with drugs being currently used against COVID-19, i.e., dexamethasone, hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir (FPV), and remdesivir (RDV). Moreover, through the molecular docking approach, we recorded the inhibitions of ferrocene derivatives on core protease (6LU7) protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the effect of substituents on the anti-COVID activity of these synthesized compounds. The computational outcome indicated that L1 has a powerful 6LU7 inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 compared to the currently used drugs. These results could be helpful to design new ferrocene compounds and explore their potential application in the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.

34990709|t|Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness and immune response among individuals in clinical risk groups.
34990709|a|BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccines approved in the UK are highly effective in general population cohorts, however, data on effectiveness among individuals with clinical conditions that place them at increased risk of severe disease are limited. METHODS: We used GP electronic health record data, sentinel virology swabbing and antibody testing within a cohort of 712 general practices across England to estimate vaccine antibody response and vaccine effectiveness against medically attended COVID-19 among individuals in clinical risk groups using cohort and test-negative case control designs. FINDINGS: There was no reduction in S-antibody positivity in most clinical risk groups, however reduced S-antibody positivity and response was significant in the immunosuppressed group. Reduced vaccine effectiveness against clinical disease was also noted in the immunosuppressed group; after a second dose, effectiveness was moderate (Pfizer: 59.6%, 95%CI 18.0-80.1%; AstraZeneca 60.0%, 95%CI -63.6-90.2%). INTERPRETATION: In most clinical risk groups, immune response to primary vaccination was maintained and high levels of vaccine effectiveness were seen. Reduced antibody response and vaccine effectiveness were seen after 1 dose of vaccine among a broad immunosuppressed group, and second dose vaccine effectiveness was moderate. These findings support maximising coverage in immunosuppressed individuals and the policy of prioritisation of this group for third doses.

34984105|t|A call for international research on COVID-19-induced brain dysfunctions.
34984105|a|COVID-19-induced brain dysfunction (CIBD) will put a strain on world health systems complicated by the heterogeneity of manifestations, which is higher than any other aspect of human biology. Neural, psychological and social causes must be disentangled for effective population-level management of CIBD. International cooperation is required in order to discover neurotechnologies appropriate for health systems.

34960755|t|SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant Displays Moderate Resistance to Neutralizing Antibodies and Spike Protein Properties of Higher Soluble ACE2 Sensitivity, Enhanced Cleavage and Fusogenic Activity.
34960755|a|The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 lineage variants, Kappa (B.1.617.1) and Delta (B.1.617.2, AY) emerged during the second wave of infections in India, but the Delta variants have become dominant worldwide and continue to evolve. Here, we compared B.1.617 variants for neutralization resistance by convalescent sera, mRNA vaccine-elicited sera, and therapeutic neutralizing antibodies using a pseudovirus neutralization assay. B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, and AY.1 pseudoviruses showed a modest 1.5- to 4.4-fold reduction in neutralization by convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited sera. In comparison, similar modest reductions were also observed for C.37, P.1, R.1, and B.1.526 pseudoviruses, but 7- and 16-fold reductions for vaccine-elicited and convalescent sera, respectively, were seen for B.1.351 pseudoviruses. Among twenty-three therapeutic antibodies tested, four antibodies showed either complete or partial loss of neutralization against B.1.617.2 pseudoviruses and six antibodies showed either complete or partial loss of neutralization against B.1.617.1 and AY.1 pseudoviruses. Our results indicate that the current mRNA-based vaccines will likely remain effective in protecting against B.1.617 variants. Finally, the P681R substitution confers efficient cleavage of B.1.617 variants' spike proteins and the spike of Delta variants exhibited greater sensitivity to soluble ACE2 neutralization, as well as fusogenic activity, which may contribute to enhanced spread of Delta variants.

33550776|t|Review of COVID-19 Vaccines and Their Evidence in Older Adults.
33550776|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a global pandemic and significant loss of life. Older people are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infections and complications; thus, they are a priority group to receive COVID-19 vaccines. This review discusses considerations for COVID-19 vaccines for older adults. The general concepts of vaccine effectiveness in older adults are described, particularly immune senescence and vaccine development approaches to improve immunogenicity. The types of COVID-19 vaccine platforms are also described before reviewing the available, although limited, evidence from phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trials relevant to older adults. The BNT162b2 vaccine by Pfizer-BioNTech and mRNA-1273 vaccine from Moderna demonstrated high efficacy and immunogenicity, which were also observed in older people. While the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) by AstraZeneca demonstrated some efficacy in older people, the vaccine dose requires clarification through further studies. Finally, the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine by Janssen Pharmaceuticals shows promise as a single-dose vaccine with a potential durability of response.

34937575|t|Challenges in the control of COVID-19 outbreaks caused by the delta variant during periods of low humidity: an observational study in Sydney, Australia.
34937575|a|BACKGROUND: Since the appearance of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a growing body of evidence has suggested that weather factors, particularly temperature and humidity, influence transmission. This relationship might differ for the recently emerged B.1.617.2 (delta) variant of SARS-CoV-2. Here we use data from an outbreak in Sydney, Australia that commenced in winter and time-series analysis to investigate the association between reported cases and temperature and relative humidity. METHODS: Between 16 June and 10 September 2021, the peak of the outbreak, there were 31,662 locally-acquired cases reported in five local health districts of Sydney, Australia. The associations between daily 9:00 am and 3:00 pm temperature ( C), relative humidity (%) and their difference, and a time series of reported daily cases were assessed using univariable and multivariable generalized additive models and a 14-day exponential moving average. Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the likelihood ratio statistic were used to compare different models and determine the best fitting model. A sensitivity analysis was performed by modifying the exponential moving average. RESULTS: During the 87-day time-series, relative humidity ranged widely (< 30-98%) and temperatures were mild (approximately 11-17  C). The best-fitting (AIC: 1,119.64) generalized additive model included 14-day exponential moving averages of 9:00 am temperature (P < 0.001) and 9:00 am relative humidity (P < 0.001), and the interaction between these two weather variables (P < 0.001). Humidity was negatively associated with cases no matter whether temperature was high or low. The effect of lower relative humidity on increased cases was more pronounced below relative humidity of about 70%; below this threshold, not only were the effects of humidity pronounced but also the relationship between temperature and cases of the delta variant becomes apparent. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the control of COVID-19 outbreaks, specifically those due to the delta variant, is particularly challenging during periods of the year with lower relative humidity and warmer temperatures. In addition to vaccination, stronger implementation of other interventions such as mask-wearing and social distancing might need to be considered during these higher risk periods.

34975811|t|Genetic Vaccination as a Flexible Tool to Overcome the Immunological Complexity of Invasive Fungal Infections.
34975811|a|The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted genetic vaccination as a powerful and cost-effective tool to counteract infectious diseases. Invasive fungal infections (IFI) remain a major challenge among immune compromised patients, particularly those undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic bone marrow transplantation (HSCT) or solid organ transplant (SOT) both presenting high morbidity and mortality rates. Candidiasis and Aspergillosis are the major fungal infections among these patients and the failure of current antifungal therapies call for new therapeutic aids. Vaccination represents a valid alternative, and proof of concept of the efficacy of this approach has been provided at clinical level. This review will analyze current understanding of antifungal immunology, with a particular focus on genetic vaccination as a suitable strategy to counteract these diseases.

34969209|t|Review of studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibitors.
34969209|a|INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 is a human infectious disease manifested by acute respiratory syndrome. On 30 January, 2020, the Word Heath Organization (WHO) declared a COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this article is to review publications on the search for substances that show inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, paying particular attention to the effect on different stages of the life cycle of the virus. REVIEW METHODS: The review was based on an analysis of the latest available scientific literature and international databases. The data collected relate to the years 2020-2021. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE: Extremely intensive research is underway to find compounds that inhibit infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Promising areas of research among the many current endeavours are antiviral compounds that stimulate the immune system, counter proliferation or affect individual viral replication cycles. These include, among others, interferons, monoclonal antibodies, natural compounds, peptides, aptamers, metal salts, and anti-inflammatory agents, inhibitors of viral enzymem, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Preparations that help the body to combat the effects of infection have also assumed much importance. CONCLUSIONS: The ongoing research is focused on the development of new antiviral agents, as well as the use of the existing drugs on the market. The results of clinical trials are promising and give hope for the development of effective therapies against SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants of this virus.

34973510|t|Analysis of the humoral and cellular immune response after a full course of BNT162b2 anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in cancer patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with or without chemotherapy: an update after 6 months of follow-up.
34973510|a|BACKGROUND: The durability of immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in cancer patients remains to be elucidated. We prospectively evaluated the immunogenicity of the vaccine in triggering both the humoral and the cell-mediated immune response in cancer patients treated with anti-programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death-ligand 1 with or without chemotherapy 6 months after BNT162b2 vaccine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the previous study, 88 patients were enrolled, whereas the analyses below refer to the 60 patients still on immunotherapy at the time of the follow-up. According to previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure, patients were classified as SARS-CoV-2-naive (without previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure) and SARS-CoV-2-experienced (with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection). Neutralizing antibody (NT Ab) titer against the B.1.1 strain and total anti-spike immunoglobulin G concentration were quantified in serum samples. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay was used for quantification of anti-spike interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-producing cells/106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Fifty patients (83.0%) were on immunotherapy alone, whereas 10 patients (7%) were on chemo-immunotherapy. We analyzed separately patients on immunotherapy and patients on chemo-immunotherapy. RESULTS: The median T-cell response at 6 months was significantly lower than that measured at 3 weeks after vaccination [50 interquartile range (IQR) 20-118.8 versus 175 IQR 67.5-371.3 IFN-gamma-producing cells/106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells; P < 0.0001]. The median reduction of immunoglobulin G concentration was 88% in SARS-CoV-2-naive subjects and 2.1% in SARS-CoV-2-experienced subjects. SARS-CoV-2 NT Ab titer was maintained in SARS-CoV-2-experienced subjects, whereas a significant decrease was observed in SARS-CoV-2-naive subjects (from median 1 : 160, IQR 1 : 40-1 : 640 to median 1 : 20, IQR 1 : 10-1 : 40; P < 0.0001). A weak correlation was observed between SARS-CoV-2 NT Ab titer and spike-specific IFN-gamma-producing cells at both 6 months and 3 weeks after vaccination (r = 0.467; P = 0.0002 and r = 0.428; P = 0.0006, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our work highlights a reduction in the immune response in cancer patients, particularly in SARS-CoV-2-naive subjects. Our data support administering a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine to cancer patients treated with programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitors.

34938933|t|Tracking and Controlling the Spatiotemporal Spread of SARS-CoV-2 Lineage B.1.1.7 in COVID-19 Reopenings.
34938933|a|Understanding why or how the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has occurred and how to control them is crucial as regards the potential of global reopening. To explore and further understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of the B.1.1.7 spread in the 368 districts of Taiwan, a district-level geographic prediction model of the risk of COVID-19 symptom onset has been proposed. It has been found that, (a) the human mobility, epidemic alert measures, and vaccination rates all played an important role in the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of B.1.1.7 transmission; (b) for regions with high human mobility and low vaccination rates, the partial relaxation of entry quarantine measures for specific imported groups would, in fact, lead to a wide spread of B.1.1.7 with a consequent doubling of high-onset-risk areas and together with the overall onset risk, a further increase of more than 20% would occur; (c) compared with the closing of business places and public venues in all districts, both lockdown in those areas of high-onset-risk and the gathered control effects regarding other districts, the control of B.1.1.7 spread would be better enabled by an onset risk reduction of up to 91.36%. Additionally, an increase in the vaccination rate in each district by up to 5-10 times would further reduce the onset risk by 6.07%-62.22%.

34979606|t|Who Influences the Public Intention to Get a COVID-19 Vaccine and What are the Public References and Concerns? A Population Survey in Vietnam.
34979606|a|BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine acceptance is influenced by the trusted recommenders. This survey examined the public references, concerns, and trust in seven groups of recommenders regarding COVID-19 vaccine in Vietnam. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 1,579 participants between April 16 and July 16, 2021. Participants' references, concerns, and responses to vaccination recommendations made by government officials, employers, physicians, nurses, pharmacists, senior family members, and religious leaders were captured using a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: Rates of trust ranged from 18.5% to 89.1%. The highest rates were attributable to government (89.1%) and physicians (85.9%). Less than half of participants would accept the vaccines if pharmacists (45.5%), nurses (44.7%), employers (42.4%), senior family members (28.1%), and religious leaders (18.4%) recommended it. Only 37.6% of participants thought that vaccines were safe for them, while 57% were unsure. Most participants would wait and see how people respond to the vaccines before getting vaccinated (91.5%), preferred to receive the vaccines at public hospitals (88.6%), and were concerned about vaccine effectiveness (86.9%) and side effects (76.4%), while 61.8% were concerned about vaccine cost. CONCLUSION: Focusing on the personal benefit and relying on the government, physicians, and social role models would make the vaccine advertising campaigns more effective. If annual vaccinations were needed, providing the community with affordable vaccines would be an appropriate, long-term solution to ensure vaccination coverage in low-resource countries like Vietnam. Further studies are needed to examine reasons for the public reference of vaccination centers which may help in improving their confidence in getting the vaccine, regardless of the settings.

33332292|t|The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' Interim Recommendation for Use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine - United States, December 2020.
33332292|a|On December 11, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 (BNT162b2) vaccine (Pfizer, Inc; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine encoding the prefusion spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1). Vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine consists of 2 doses (30 mug, 0.3 mL each) administered intramuscularly, 3 weeks apart. On December 12, 2020, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued an interim recommendation* for use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in persons aged >=16 years for the prevention of COVID-19. To guide its deliberations regarding the vaccine, ACIP employed the Evidence to Recommendation (EtR) Framework,  using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.  The recommendation for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine should be implemented in conjunction with ACIP's interim recommendation for allocating initial supplies of COVID-19 vaccines (2). The ACIP recommendation for the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine under EUA is interim and will be updated as additional information becomes available.

34921432|t|Antibody responses to COVID-19 vaccines in older adults.
34921432|a|Because of the senescence of the immune system, antibody response to the COVID-19 vaccines may differ from older in younger adults. The study aim compare the titers of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody of patients >= 60 years who received 3 doses of CoronaVac vaccine and those who received 2 doses of CoronaVac+1 dose of Pfizer-BioNTech after one month of the last vaccination. Patients >=60 years who received the CoronaVac vaccine between March 1, 2021, and April 30, 2021, who didn't have COVID-19 disease before the 1st dose of vaccination and were negative for COVID-19 antibodies, whose antibodies were tested before the 3rd dose of vaccination, and who didn't have any COVID-19 disease during the follow-up were included. The demographic characteristics and comorbidities of patients were recorded. An immunofluorescence assay (IFA) fast test and a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (Abbott) were used to measure SARS-CoV-2 quantitative antibody levels at 1st month after 3-dose vaccine. Totally 81 patients, 41 patients in third dose CoronaVac group (female:male 18:23, mean age 69.4+-8.5), and 40 patients in third dose Pfizer-BioNTech group (female:male 15:25, mean age 69.9+-9.1) were included. The patients' comorbidities in the groups were similar. The titers of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 measured according to both IFA and Abbott kit at the first month the 3rd dose vaccination was significantly higher in Pfizer-BioNTech group (respectively; p=>0.001, p=0.012). The results report that the formed immunity in the first month after the two doses CoronaVac+one dose Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was higher than three doses CoronaVac vaccine in older adults.

34978702|t|Humoral Immune Response to COVID-19 Vaccination in Hemodialysis Patients: A Retrospective, Observational Case-Control Pilot Study.
34978702|a|INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus 2 disease is associated with increased mortality and morbidity in chronic hemodialysis patients METHODS: A retrospective, observational case-control pilot study was conducted on consecutive hemodialysis outpatients (cases) and control group of individuals with preserved renal function. Complete SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, followed by determination of serum antibodies after the second dose, were required from participants in both groups. Previous COVID-19 was an exclusion criterium. RESULTS: 21 hemodialysis patients (M:F = 13:8, mean age 67.5 +- 13.4) and 16 controls without chronic kidney disease (M:F = 4:12, mean age 46.8 +- 12.7) were included. Hemodialysis patients had lower mean titers of serum antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen compared with controls (492.39 vs 1901.20 IU/mL, respectively; p < 0.001), a finding that was confirmed in the age-matched analysis on 18 participants (580.8 vs 1836.4 IU/mL, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the finding of hyporesponsiveness to mRNA vaccination among hemodialysis patients.

34963008|a|We have investigated the evolution of the neutralizing response against SARS-CoV-2 variants at 8 months after Pfizer-BNT162b2 vaccination in COVID-19 naive (n=21) and COVID-19 convalescent (n=21) individuals. Neutralizing levels declined for all variants (range 2-3.7-fold). Eight months after vaccination a significant proportion (4/21) of naive individuals lacked detectable neutralizing activity against the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 delta variant. In the "convalescent" group the impressive high initial humoral response resulted in detectable neutralizing antibody levels against all variants throughout this period.

35624652|a|SARS-CoV-2 vaccines provide strong protection against COVID-19. However, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has raised concerns about the efficacy of vaccines. In this study, we investigated the interactions of specific polyclonal human antibodies (pAb-SCoV2-S) produced after vaccination with the Vaxzevria vaccine with the spike proteins of three SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern: wild-type, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351. Highly sensitive, label-free, and real-time monitoring of these interactions was accomplished using the total internal reflection ellipsometry method. Thermodynamic parameters such as association and dissociation rate constants, the stable immune complex formation rate constant (kr), the equilibrium association and dissociation (KD) constants and steric factors (Ps) were calculated using a two-step irreversible binding mathematical model. The results obtained show that the KD values for the specific antibody interactions with all three types of spike protein are in the same nanomolar range. The KD values for B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 suggest that the antibody produced after vaccination can successfully protect the population from the alpha (B.1.1.7) and beta (B.1.351) SARS-CoV-2 mutations. The steric factors (Ps) obtained for all three types of spike proteins showed a 100-fold lower requirement for the formation of an immune complex when compared with nucleocapsid protein.

34946187|t|Comprehensive Contact Tracing, Testing and Sequencing Show Limited Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between Children in Schools in Norway, August 2020 to May 2021.
34946187|a|The role of children in the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in schools has been a topic of controversy. In this study among school contacts of SARS-CoV-2 positive children in 43 contact-investigations, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Norway, August 2020-May 2021. All participants were tested twice within seven to ten days, using SARS-CoV-2 PCR on home-sampled saliva. Positive samples were whole genome sequenced. Among the 559 child contacts, eight tested positive (1.4%, 95% CI 0.62-2.80), with no significant difference between primary (1.0%, 95% CI 0.27-2.53) and secondary schools (2.6%, 95% CI 0.70-6.39), p = 0.229, nor by viral strain, non-Alpha (1.4%, 95% CI 0.50-2.94) and Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) (1.7%, 95% CI 0.21-5.99), p = 0.665. One adult contact (1/100) tested positive. In 34 index cases, we detected 13 different SARS-CoV-2 Pango lineage variants, with B.1.1.7 being most frequent. In the eight contact-investigations with SARS-CoV-2 positive contacts, four had the same sequence identity as the index, one had no relation, and three were inconclusive. With mitigation measures in place, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 from children in schools is limited. By excluding contact-investigations with adult cases known at the time of enrolment, our data provide a valid estimate on the role of children in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools.

34917580|t|The Disease Severity and Clinical Outcomes of the SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern.
34917580|a|With the continuation of the pandemic, many severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants have appeared around the world. Owing to a possible risk of increasing the transmissibility of the virus, severity of the infected individuals, and the ability to escape the antibody produced by the vaccines, the four SARS-CoV-2 variants of Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), and Delta (B.1.617.2) have attracted the most widespread attention. At present, there is a unified conclusion that these four variants have increased the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, but the severity of the disease caused by them has not yet been determined. Studies from June 1, 2020 to October 15, 2021 were considered, and a meta-analysis was carried out to process the data. Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants are all more serious than the wild-type virus in terms of hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality, and the Beta and Delta variants have a higher risk than the Alpha and Gamma variants. Notably, the random effects of Beta variant to the wild-type virus with respect to hospitalization rate, severe illness rate, and mortality rate are 2.16 (95% CI: 1.19-3.14), 2.23 (95% CI: 1.31-3.15), and 1.50 (95% CI: 1.26-1.74), respectively, and the random effects of Delta variant to the wild-type virus are 2.08 (95% CI: 1.77-2.39), 3.35 (95% CI: 2.5-4.2), and 2.33 (95% CI: 1.45-3.21), respectively. Although, the emergence of vaccines may reduce the threat posed by SARS-CoV-2 variants, these are still very important, especially the Beta and Delta variants.

33545094|t|Safety and efficacy of an rAd26 and rAd5 vector-based heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccine: an interim analysis of a randomised controlled phase 3 trial in Russia.
33545094|a|BACKGROUND: A heterologous recombinant adenovirus (rAd)-based vaccine, Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V), showed a good safety profile and induced strong humoral and cellular immune responses in participants in phase 1/2 clinical trials. Here, we report preliminary results on the efficacy and safety of Gam-COVID-Vac from the interim analysis of this phase 3 trial. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at 25 hospitals and polyclinics in Moscow, Russia. We included participants aged at least 18 years, with negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR and IgG and IgM tests, no infectious diseases in the 14 days before enrolment, and no other vaccinations in the 30 days before enrolment. Participants were randomly assigned (3:1) to receive vaccine or placebo, with stratification by age group. Investigators, participants, and all study staff were masked to group assignment. The vaccine was administered (0 5 mL/dose) intramuscularly in a prime-boost regimen: a 21-day interval between the first dose (rAd26) and the second dose (rAd5), both vectors carrying the gene for the full-length SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein S. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 from day 21 after receiving the first dose. All analyses excluded participants with protocol violations: the primary outcome was assessed in participants who had received two doses of vaccine or placebo, serious adverse events were assessed in all participants who had received at least one dose at the time of database lock, and rare adverse events were assessed in all participants who had received two doses and for whom all available data were verified in the case report form at the time of database lock. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04530396). FINDINGS: Between Sept 7 and Nov 24, 2020, 21 977 adults were randomly assigned to the vaccine group (n=16 501) or the placebo group (n=5476). 19 866 received two doses of vaccine or placebo and were included in the primary outcome analysis. From 21 days after the first dose of vaccine (the day of dose 2), 16 (0 1%) of 14 964 participants in the vaccine group and 62 (1 3%) of 4902 in the placebo group were confirmed to have COVID-19; vaccine efficacy was 91 6% (95% CI 85 6-95 2). Most reported adverse events were grade 1 (7485 [94 0%] of 7966 total events). 45 (0 3%) of 16 427 participants in the vaccine group and 23 (0 4%) of 5435 participants in the placebo group had serious adverse events; none were considered associated with vaccination, with confirmation from the independent data monitoring committee. Four deaths were reported during the study (three [<0 1%] of 16 427 participants in the vaccine group and one [<0 1%] of 5435 participants in the placebo group), none of which were considered related to the vaccine. INTERPRETATION: This interim analysis of the phase 3 trial of Gam-COVID-Vac showed 91 6% efficacy against COVID-19 and was well tolerated in a large cohort. FUNDING: Moscow City Health Department, Russian Direct Investment Fund, and Sberbank.

34982465|t|Omicron SARS-CoV-2 new variant: global prevalence and biological and clinical characteristics.
34982465|a|OBJECTIVE: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created a challenging and threatening situation worldwide. The SARS-CoV-2 embodies diverse epidemiological trends, alongside emerging and reemerging pathogenic characteristics, which have raised great public health concerns. This study aims to investigate the global prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics of Omicron, a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 that is causing concern and fear internationally. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data on the outbreak of the new variant "Omicron" was obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), research institutes, and global international print media. We recorded information on the prevalence, the biological and clinical characteristics of the Omicron Variant of SARS-CoV-2 from November 24 to December 9, 2021. RESULTS: Worldwide, the new variant of SARS-CoV-2, Omicron, has been identified in 57 countries with 2152 confirmed cases reported on December 9, 2021, ever since the emergence of the first case of this variant dated November 24, 2021. The number of confirmed Omicron variant cases has significantly increased globally. The novel variant is spreading swiftly and has crossed many borders all around the world. This new variant has been observed to be transmitted far more rapidly than other variants of SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: The new variant of SARS-CoV-2 has novel epidemiological and biological characteristics, making it more contagious than other variants of SARS-CoV-2. It has affected 2152 people in 57 countries in a short period of two weeks. However, the fatality rate of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has not yet been reported. The major clinical manifestations in this new variant are those of a "mild infection", including headache, body ache, muscles ache, cough, fever, generalized myalgia, and severe fatigue. It is infecting younger and middle-aged people more than previous variants. Worldwide health establishments should take immediate preventive measures to stop outbreaks of this emerging and reemerging pathogenic variant across the globe to minimize the disease burden on humanity.

34968370|t|COVID-19 Vaccine Safety in Children Aged 5-11 Years - United States, November 3-December 19, 2021.
34968370|a|On October 29, 2021, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) amended the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 (BNT162b2) mRNA vaccine to expand its use to children aged 5-11 years, administered as 2 doses (10 mug, 0.2mL each) 3 weeks apart (1). As of December 19, 2021, only the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is authorized for administration to children aged 5-17 years (2,3). In preauthorization clinical trials, Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was administered to 3,109 children aged 5-11 years; most adverse events were mild to moderate, and no serious adverse events related to vaccination were reported (4). To further characterize safety of the vaccine in children aged 5-11 years, CDC reviewed adverse events after receipt of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a passive vaccine safety surveillance system co-managed by CDC and FDA, and adverse events and health impact assessments reported to v-safe, a voluntary smartphone-based safety surveillance system for adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination,* during November 3-December 19, 2021. Approximately 8.7 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine were administered to children aged 5-11 years  during this period; VAERS received 4,249 reports of adverse events after vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in this age group, 4,149 (97.6%) of which were not serious. Approximately 42,504 children aged 5-11 years were enrolled in v-safe after vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine; after dose 2, a total of 17,180 (57.5%) local and 12,223 systemic (40.9%) reactions (including injection-site pain, fatigue, or headache) were reported. The preliminary safety findings are similar to those from preauthorization clinical trials (4,5). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 5-11 years for the prevention of COVID-19 (6). Parents and guardians of children aged 5-11 years vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine should be advised that local and systemic reactions are expected after vaccination. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent COVID-19. CDC and FDA will continue to monitor vaccine safety and will provide updates as needed to guide COVID-19 vaccination recommendations.

35632562|t|Safety and Immunogenicity of the BBIBP-CorV Vaccine in Adolescents Aged 12 to 17 Years in the Thai Population: An Immunobridging Study.
35632562|a|Adolescents can develop a severe form of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially with underlying comorbidities. No study has examined the efficacy or effectiveness of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines in adolescents. This single-center, prospective cohort study was performed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine in adolescents using the immunobridging approach at Chulabhorn Hospital. The key eligibility criterion was a healthy clinical condition or stable pre-existing comorbidity. The anti-receptor-binding domain (anti-RBD) antibody concentration at 4 weeks after dose 2 of the vaccine was compared between participants aged 12 to 17 years and those aged 18 to 30 years. Safety profiles included adverse events within 7 days after each dose of the vaccine and any adverse events through 1 month after dose 2 of the vaccine. In the adolescent and adult cohorts, the geometric mean concentration of anti-RBD antibody was 102.9 binding antibody unit (BAU)/mL (95% CI, 91.0-116.4) and 36.9 BAU/mL (95% CI, 30.9-44.0), respectively. The geometric mean ratio of the adolescent cohort was 2.79 (95% CI, 2.25-3.46, p < 0.0001) compared with the adult cohort, meeting the non-inferiority criterion. The reactogenicity was slightly lower in the adolescent than in the adult cohort. No serious adverse events occurred. The inactivated COVID-19 vaccine appears safe and effective in adolescents.

35607743|t|A Case Report of Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus and Meningitis After COVID-19 Vaccination.
35607743|a|There are several reports that herpes zoster characterized by reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV) following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines can occur. Herein, we report VZV meningitis, herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO), and late neurotrophic keratitis after receiving a second dose of messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine. A 74-year-old man developed a vesicular skin rash on the forehead, scalp, nose, and left upper eyelid with a severe headache. Five days earlier, he received a second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine on his left arm. Ocular examination revealed conjunctival hyperemia and pseudodendrite in the peripheral cornea. VZV was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid using polymerase chain reaction. The patient was diagnosed with HZO and meningitis. The patient was treated with intravenous acyclovir and topical acyclovir ointment and levofloxacin 1.5% eye drops. One month later, he developed a central epithelial defect with a rolled margin, typical of a neurotrophic ulcer. Treatment with a therapeutic contact lens and a combination of topical recombinant human epithelial growth factor and ofloxacin ointment was initiated. At six months after vaccination, the slit-lamp examination findings were stable with a mild corneal superficial stromal haze.

34946288|t|Melting and Re-Freezing Leads to Irreversible Changes in the Morphology and Molecular-Level Dynamics of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.
34946288|a|Background and Objectives: As an mRNA-based vaccine, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has stringent cold storage requirements to preserve functionality of the mRNA active ingredient. To this end, lipid components of the vaccine formulation play an important role in stabilizing and protecting the mRNA molecule for long-term storage. The purpose of the current study was to measure molecular-level dynamics as a function of temperature in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to gain microscopic insight into its thermal stability. Materials and Methods: We used quasielastic and inelastic neutron scattering to probe (1) the vaccine extracted from the manufacturer-supplied vials and (2) unperturbed vaccine in the original manufacturer-supplied vials. The latter measurement was possible due to the high penetrative power of neutrons. Results: Upon warming from the low-temperature frozen state, the vaccine in its original form exhibits two-step melting, indicative of a two-phase morphology. Once the melting is completed (above 0  C), vaccine re-freezing cannot restore its original two-phase state. This observation is corroborated by the changes in the molecular vibrational spectra. The molecular-level mobility measured in the resulting single-phase state of the re-frozen vaccine greatly exceeds the mobility measured in the original vaccine. Conclusions: Even a brief melting (above 0  C) leads to an irreversible alteration of the two-phase morphology of the original vaccine formulation. Re-freezing of the vaccine results in a one-phase morphology with much increased molecular-level mobility compared to that in the original vaccine, suggesting irreversible deterioration of the vaccine's in-storage stability. Neutron scattering can be used to distinguish between the vibrational spectra characteristic of the original and deteriorated vaccines contained in the unperturbed original manufacturer-supplied vials.

33496089|t|Epidemiologic Linkage of COVID-19 Outbreaks at Two University-affiliated Hospitals in the Seoul Metropolitan Area in March 2020.
33496089|a|BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks emerged at two university-affiliated hospitals in Seoul (hospital A) and Uijeongbu City (hospital S) in the metropolitan Seoul area in March 2020. The aim of this study was to investigate epidemiological links between the outbreaks using whole genome sequencing (WGS) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: Fifteen patients were enrolled in the study, including four non-outbreak (A1-A4) and three outbreak cases (A5-A7) in hospital A and eight cases (S1-S8) in hospital S. Patients' hospital stays, COVID-19 symptoms, and transfer history were reviewed. RNA samples were submitted for WGS and genome-wide single nucleotide variants and phylogenetic relationships were analyzed. RESULTS: The index patient (A5) in hospital A was transferred from hospital S on 26 March. Patients A6 and A7 were the family caregiver and sister, respectively, of the patient who shared a room with A5 for 4 days. Prior to transfer, A5 was at the next bed to S8 in the emergency room on 25 March. Patient S6, a professional caregiver, took care of the patient in the room next to S8's room for 5 days until 22 March and then S5 for another 3 days. WGS revealed that SARS-CoV-2 in A2, A3, and A4 belong to clades V/B.2, S/A, and G/B.1, respectively, whereas that of A5-A7 and S1-S5 are of the V/B.2.1 clade and closely clustered. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 in patients A5 and S5 showed perfect identity. CONCLUSION: WGS is a useful tool to understand epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. It is the first study to elucidate the role of patient transfer and caregivers as links of nosocomial outbreaks of COVID-19 in multiple hospitals.

33558825|t|COVID-19 vaccine-associated anaphylaxis: A statement of the World Allergy Organization Anaphylaxis Committee.
33558825|a|Vaccines against COVID-19 (and its emerging variants) are an essential global intervention to control the current pandemic situation. Vaccines often cause adverse events; however, the vast majority of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) are a consequence of the vaccine stimulating a protective immune response, and not allergic in etiology. Anaphylaxis as an AEFI is uncommon, occurring at a rate of less than 1 per million doses for most vaccines. However, within the first days of initiating mass vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2, there were reports of anaphylaxis from the United Kingdom and United States. More recent data imply an incidence of anaphylaxis closer to 1:200,000 doses with respect to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. In this position paper, we discuss the background to reactions to the current COVID-19 vaccines and relevant steps to mitigate against the risk of anaphylaxis as an AEFI. We propose a global surveillance strategy led by allergists in order to understand the potential risk and generate data to inform evidence-based guidance, and thus provide reassurance to public health bodies and members of the public.

35632688|a|Neutralizing antibody (NAb) detection is critical for evaluating herd immunity and monitoring the efficacy of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this study, quantitative SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels after vaccination were measured by chemiluminescent immunoassays, enzyme immunoassays, and surrogate virus neutralization tests (sVNTs), as well as plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT). Sequential blood samples were collected before and 1 and 3 months after vaccination in 30 healthy participants (two doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca [AZ] or Pfizer-BioNTech [BNT]). After vaccination, all sera tested positive for PRNT, with NAb titers ranging from 1:10 to 1:723. Median NAb titers were higher in the BNT vaccine group than in the AZ vaccine group at both one and three months post-vaccination. Excellent overall concordance rates were observed between serological assays and PRNT. In a quantitative correlation analysis, the results of sVNTs showed a strong correlation with those of PRNT. Results of the four binding antibody assays showed a significant correlation with those of PRNT. The serologic assays evaluated in this study could be used as sVNTs to evaluate the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

34980623|t|First and second waves among hospitalised patients with COVID-19 with severe pneumonia: a comparison of 28-day mortality over the 1-year pandemic in a tertiary university hospital in Italy.
34980623|a|OBJECTIVE: The first COVID-19-19 epidemic wave was over the period of February-May 2020. Since 1 October 2020, Italy, as many other European countries, faced a second wave. The aim of this analysis was to compare the 28-day mortality between the two waves among COVID-19 hospitalised patients. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. Standard survival analysis was performed to compare all-cause mortality within 28 days after hospital admission in the two waves. Kaplan-Meier curves as well as Cox regression model analysis were used. The effect of wave on risk of death was shown by means of HRs with 95% CIs. A sensitivity analysis around the impact of the circulating variant as a potential unmeasured confounder was performed. SETTING: University Hospital of Modena, Italy. Patients admitted to the hospital for severe COVID-19 pneumonia during the first (22 February-31 May 2020) and second (1 October-31 December 2020) waves were included. RESULTS: During the two study periods, a total of 1472 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were admitted to our hospital, 449 during the first wave and 1023 during the second. Median age was 70 years (IQR 56-80), 37% women, 49% with PaO2/FiO2 <250 mm Hg, 82% with >=1 comorbidity, median duration of symptoms was 6 days. 28-day mortality rate was 20.0% (95% CI 16.3 to 23.7) during the first wave vs 14.2% (95% CI 12.0 to 16.3) in the second (log-rank test p value=0.03). After including key predictors of death in the multivariable Cox regression model, the data still strongly suggested a lower 28-day mortality rate in the second wave (aHR=0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.90, p value=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In our hospitalised patients with COVID-19 with severe pneumonia, the 28-day mortality appeared to be reduced by 36% during the second as compared with the first wave. Further studies are needed to identify factors that may have contributed to this improved survival.

33531709|t|Sixteen novel lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in South Africa.
33531709|a|The first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in South Africa was identified on 5 March 2020, and by 26 March the country was in full lockdown (Oxford stringency index of 90)1. Despite the early response, by November 2020, over 785,000 people in South Africa were infected, which accounted for approximately 50% of all known African infections2. In this study, we analyzed 1,365 near whole genomes and report the identification of 16 new lineages of SARS-CoV-2 isolated between 6 March and 26 August 2020. Most of these lineages have unique mutations that have not been identified elsewhere. We also show that three lineages (B.1.1.54, B.1.1.56 and C.1) spread widely in South Africa during the first wave, comprising ~42% of all infections in the country at the time. The newly identified C lineage of SARS-CoV-2, C.1, which has 16 nucleotide mutations as compared with the original Wuhan sequence, including one amino acid change on the spike protein, D614G (ref. 3), was the most geographically widespread lineage in South Africa by the end of August 2020. An early South African-specific lineage, B.1.106, which was identified in April 2020 (ref. 4), became extinct after nosocomial outbreaks were controlled in KwaZulu-Natal Province. Our findings show that genomic surveillance can be implemented on a large scale in Africa to identify new lineages and inform measures to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Such genomic surveillance presented in this study has been shown to be crucial in the identification of the 501Y.V2 variant in South Africa in December 2020 (ref. 5).

35618549|t|Management of drug-drug interactions with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in patients treated for Covid-19: Guidelines from the French Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics (SFPT).
35618549|a|OBJECTIVES: Nirmatrelvir in association with ritonavir (PAXLOVID , Pfizer) is an antiviral agent targeting the 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease enzyme (3C-like protease or Mpro) which is a key enzyme of the viral cycle of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This combination with a well-known pharmacokinetic enhancer leads to a high risk for drug-drug interactions in a polymedicated elected population for treatment. The aim of this work was to provide recommendations on behalf of the national French society of pharmacology (French Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutics; SFPT), by suggesting optimal and pragmatic therapeutic strategies if nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is to be given together with drugs commonly used, in order to ensure secured physicians' prescription. METHODS: Six clinical pharmacologists search the scientific literature to provide a first draft of recommendations. Thereafter, twelve other clinical pharmacologists verified the recommendations and proposed modifications. The final draft was then validated by all 18 participants. RESULTS: Five distinct recommendations were issued: i) contra-indications, ii) "PAXLOVID  not recommended with the comedication", iii) "PAXLOVID  possible whether the comedication is discontinued", iv) "PAXLOVID  possible only after an expert advice" and v) "PAXLOVID  possible without modification of the associated treatment". The final document comprises recommendations for 171 drugs/therapeutic classes aiming to secure prescription. In complex situations, clinicians are advised to contact their pharmacology department to obtain specific recommendations on the management of drug-drug interactions with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. CONCLUSION: These recommendations intend to be a help for clinicians willing to prescribe nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and to prevent drug-drug interactions leading to adverse drug reactions or loss of efficacy. They constitute a guideline for primary care situations. Of course, some complex situations may require expert advices and here, again, clinical pharmacologists are at the forefront in providing therapeutic advice.

33508241|t|SARS-CoV-2 vaccination for patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a British Society of Gastroenterology Inflammatory Bowel Disease section and IBD Clinical Research Group position statement.
33508241|a|SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global health crisis and mass vaccination programmes provide the best opportunity for controlling transmission and protecting populations. Despite the impressive clinical trial results of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford/AstraZeneca), and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines, important unanswered questions remain, especially in patients with pre-existing conditions. In this position statement endorsed by the British Society of Gastroenterology Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) section and IBD Clinical Research Group, we consider SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategy in patients with IBD. The risks of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are anticipated to be very low, and we strongly support SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with IBD. Based on data from previous studies with other vaccines, there are conceptual concerns that protective immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may be diminished in some patients with IBD, such as those taking anti-TNF drugs. However, the benefits of vaccination, even in patients treated with anti-TNF drugs, are likely to outweigh these theoretical concerns. Key areas for further research are discussed, including vaccine hesitancy and its effect in the IBD community, the effect of immunosuppression on vaccine efficacy, and the search for predictive biomarkers of vaccine success.

34968374|t|Characteristics and Clinical Outcomes of Children and Adolescents Aged <18 Years Hospitalized with COVID-19 - Six Hospitals, United States, July-August 2021.
34968374|a|During June 2021, the highly transmissible  B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, became the predominant circulating strain in the United States. U.S. pediatric COVID-19-related hospitalizations increased during July-August 2021 following emergence of the Delta variant and peaked in September 2021.  As of May 12, 2021, CDC recommended COVID-19 vaccinations for persons aged >=12 years,  and on November 2, 2021, COVID-19 vaccinations were recommended for persons aged 5-11 years.** To date, clinical signs and symptoms, illness course, and factors contributing to hospitalizations during the period of Delta predominance have not been well described in pediatric patients. CDC partnered with six children's hospitals to review medical record data for patients aged <18 years with COVID-19-related hospitalizations during July-August 2021.   Among 915 patients identified, 713 (77.9%) were hospitalized for COVID-19 (acute COVID-19 as the primary or contributing reason for hospitalization), 177 (19.3%) had incidental positive SARS-CoV-2 test results (asymptomatic or mild infection unrelated to the reason for hospitalization), and 25 (2.7%) had multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a rare but serious inflammatory condition associated with COVID-19.   Among the 713 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, 24.7% were aged <1 year, 17.1% were aged 1-4 years, 20.1% were aged 5-11 years, and 38.1% were aged 12-17 years. Approximately two thirds of patients (67.5%) had one or more underlying medical conditions, with obesity being the most common (32.4%); among patients aged 12-17 years, 61.4% had obesity. Among patients hospitalized for COVID-19, 15.8% had a viral coinfection   (66.4% of whom had respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] infection). Approximately one third (33.9%) of patients aged <5 years hospitalized for COVID-19 had a viral coinfection. Among 272 vaccine-eligible (aged 12-17 years) patients hospitalized for COVID-19, one (0.4%) was fully vaccinated.*** Approximately one half (54.0%) of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 received oxygen support, 29.5% were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 1.5% died; of those requiring respiratory support, 14.5% required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Among pediatric patients with COVID-19-related hospitalizations, many had severe illness and viral coinfections, and few vaccine-eligible patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were vaccinated, highlighting the importance of vaccination for those aged >=5 years and other prevention strategies to protect children and adolescents from COVID-19, particularly those with underlying medical conditions.

35597847|t|Definition of factors associated with negative antibody response after COVID-19 vaccination in patients with hematological diseases.
35597847|a|COVID-19 in patients with hematological diseases is associated with a high mortality. Moreover, preventive vaccination demonstrated reduced efficacy and the knowledge on influencing factors is limited. In this single-center study, antibody levels of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were measured >= 2 weeks after 2nd COVID-19 vaccination with a concentration >= 0.8 U/mL considered positive. Between July and October 2021, in a total of 373 patients (median age 64 years, 44% women) with myeloid neoplasms (n = 214, 57%), lymphoid neoplasms (n = 124, n = 33%), and other diseases (n = 35, 10%), vaccination was performed with BNT162b2 (BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), ChADOx1 (AstraZeneca), or a combination. A total of 229 patients (61%) were on active therapy within 3 months prior vaccination and 144 patients (39%) were previously treated or treatment naive. Vaccination-related antibody response was negative in 56/373 patients (15%): in 39/124 patients with lymphoid neoplasms, 13/214 with myeloid neoplasms, and 4/35 with other diseases. Active treatment per se was not correlated with negative response. However, rituximab and BTK inhibitor treatment were correlated significantly with a negative vaccination response, whereas younger age and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) disease were associated with positive response. In addition, 5 of 6 patients with myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) and negative vaccination response were on active treatment with ruxolitinib. In conclusion, a remarkable percentage of patients with hematological diseases had no response after 2nd COVID-19 vaccination. Multivariable analysis revealed important factors associated with response to vaccination. The results may serve as a guide for better protection and surveillance in this vulnerable patient cohort.

34992610|t|A Single Dose SARS-CoV-2 Replicon RNA Vaccine Induces Cellular and Humoral Immune Responses in Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Infected and Uninfected Pigtail Macaques.
34992610|a|The ongoing COVID-19 vaccine rollout is critical for reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths worldwide. Unfortunately, massive disparities exist in getting vaccines to vulnerable populations, including people living with HIV. Preliminary studies indicate that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are safe and immunogenic in people living with HIV that are virally suppressed with potent antiretroviral therapy but may be less efficacious in immunocompromised individuals. This raises the concern that COVID-19 vaccines may be less effective in resource poor settings with limited access to antiretroviral therapy. Here, we evaluated the immunogenicity of a single dose COVID-19 replicon RNA vaccine expressing Spike protein (A.1) from SARS-CoV-2 (repRNA-CoV2S) in immunocompromised, SIV infected and immune competent, naive pigtail macaques. Moderate vaccine-specific cellular Th1 T-cell responses and binding and neutralizing antibodies were induced by repRNA-CoV2S in SIV infected animals and naive animals. Furthermore, vaccine immunogenicity was elicited even among the animals with the highest SIV viral burden or lowest peripheral CD4 counts prior to immunization. This study provides evidence that a SARS-CoV-2 repRNA vaccine could be employed to induce strong immunity against COVID-19 in HIV infected and other immunocompromised individuals.

35632708|t|C57BL/6J Mice Are Not Suitable for Modeling Severe SARS-CoV-2 Beta and Gamma Variant Infection.
35632708|a|SARS-CoV-2 variants, including B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma), and B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants, have displayed increased transmissibility and, therefore, have been categorized as variants of concern (VOCs). The pervasiveness of VOCs suggests a high probability of future mutations that may lead to increased virulence. Prior reports have shown that VOC infection without expression of human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptor (hACE2) in mice is possible. We sought to understand if the increased transmissibility of VOCs can infect C57BL/6 mice without expression of hACE2 receptor required for entry of SARS-CoV-2 normally. We examined the ability of infection with Beta and Gamma variants to infect and cause both pathological and clinical changes consistent with severe COVID-19, including body weight changes, survival, subgenomic viral titer, lung histology on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, and viral protein expression as measured by immunohistochemistry staining of viral antigen (IHC). These methods were used to examine three groups of mice: C57BL6, Rag2-/-, and Ccr2-/- mice. We observed that these mice, infected with Beta and Gamma variants of SARS-CoV-2, did not show pathological changes as indicated by weight loss, altered survival, or significant lung pathology on H&E staining. Subgenomic qPCR and IHC staining for viral protein indicated that there was some evidence of infection but far below ACE2 transgenic mice, which showed clinical disease and pathologic changes consistent with ARDS. These data suggest that these variants replicate poorly even in the setting of profound immune deficiency.

34973454|t|Tracking and controlling the spatiotemporal spread of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in South Africa.
34973454|a|BACKGROUND: South Africa is the focus of the current epidemic caused by Omicron. Understanding the spatiotemporal spread of Omicron in South Africa and how to control it is crucial to global countries. METHODS: To explore the spatiotemporal spread of Omicron in 9 provinces in South Africa, a province-level geographic prediction model of COVID-19 symptom onset risk, is proposed. RESULTS: It has been found that i) The spatiotemporal spread was relatively slow during the first stage and following the emergence of Omicron in Gauteng. The spatial spread of Omicron accelerated after it had become the dominant variant, and continued to spread from Gauteng to the neighboring provinces and main transport nodes. ii) Compared with current Alert Levels 1-4 in all provinces, the imposition of lockdown in the high-onset-risk Gauteng together with the Alert Level 1 in other 8 provinces, was found to more effectively control the spread of Omicron in South Africa. Moreover, it can reduce the spread of the Omicron epidemic in the provinces where main international airports are located to other parts of the world. iii) Due to declining vaccine efficiency over time, even when the daily vaccination rates in each province increased by 10 times, the daily overall onset risk was only reduced by 0.34%-7.86%. CONCLUSIONS: Our study has provided a comprehensive investigation concerning the spatiotemporal dynamics of Omicron and hence provided scientific findings to enable a contribution which will assist in controlling the spatiotemporal spread of Omicron by integrating the prevention measures and vaccination.

35603274|t|Utilizing wearable sensors for continuous and highly-sensitive monitoring of reactions to the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.
35603274|a|Background: Clinical trial guidelines for assessing the safety of vaccines, are primarily based on self-reported questionnaires. Despite the tremendous technological advances in recent years, objective, continuous assessment of physiological measures post-vaccination is rarely performed. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study during the mass vaccination campaign in Israel. 160 participants >18 years who were not previously found to be COVID-19 positive and who received the BNT162b2 COVID-19 (Pfizer BioNTech) vaccine were equipped with an FDA-approved chest-patch sensor and a dedicated mobile application. The chest-patch sensor continuously monitored 13 different cardiovascular, and hemodynamic vitals: heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate variability, stroke volume, cardiac output, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance and skin temperature. The mobile application collected daily self-reported questionnaires on local and systemic reactions. Results: We identify continuous and significant changes following vaccine administration in nearly all vitals. Markedly, these changes are observed even in presumably asymptomatic participants who did not report any local or systemic reaction. Changes in vitals are more apparent at night, in younger participants, and in participants following the second vaccine dose. Conclusion: the considerably higher sensitivity of wearable sensors can revolutionize clinical trials by enabling earlier identification of abnormal reactions with fewer subjects.

34924897|t|In-Silico Design of a Novel Tridecapeptide Targeting Spike Protein of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern.
34924897|a|Several mutations in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have increased the transmission and mortality rate of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) across the globe. Although many vaccines have been developed, a large proportion of the global population remains at high risk of infection. The current study aims to develop an antiviral peptide capable of inhibiting the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its six major variants with the host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. An in-silico approach was employed to design a therapeutic peptide inhibitor against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3). The binding specificity and affinity of our designed peptide inhibitor Mod13AApi (YADKYQKQYKDAY) with wild-type S-RBD and its six variants was confirmed by molecular docking using the HPEPDOCK tool, whereas complex stability was determined by the MD simulation study. The physicochemical and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) properties of inhibitory peptides were determined using the ExPASy tool and pkCSM server. The docking results and its properties from our in-silico analysis present the Mod13AApi, a promising peptide for the rapid development of anti-coronavirus peptide-based antiviral therapy. Blockage of the binding of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 variants with ACE2 in the presence of the therapeutic peptide may prevent deadly SARS-CoV-2 variants entry into host cells. Therefore, the designed inhibitory peptide can be utilized as a promising therapeutic strategy to combat COVID-19, as evident from this in-silico study.

34982967|t|High-titer neutralization of Mu and C.1.2 SARS-CoV-2 variants by vaccine-elicited antibodies of previously infected individuals.
34982967|a|Recently identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants Mu and C.1.2 have spike proteins with mutations that may confer resistance to natural and vaccine-elicited antibodies. Analysis of neutralizing antibody titers in the sera of vaccinated individuals without previous history of infection and from convalescent individuals show partial resistance of the viruses. In contrast, sera from individuals with a previous history of SARS-CoV-2 infection who were subsequently vaccinated neutralize variants with titers 4- to 11-fold higher, providing a rationale for vaccination of individuals with previous infection. The heavily mutated C.1.2 spike is the most antibody neutralization-resistant spike to date; however, the avidity of C.1.2 spike protein for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is low. This finding suggests that the virus evolved to escape the humoral response but has a decrease in fitness, suggesting that it may cause milder disease or be less transmissible. It may be difficult for the spike protein to evolve to escape neutralizing antibodies while maintaining high affinity for ACE2.

33618008|t|Characterizing SARS-CoV-2 genome diversity circulating in South American countries: Signatures of potentially emergent lineages?
33618008|a|OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the genomic diversity and geographic distribution of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in South America. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 lineages from a public dataset of 5583 South American genome assemblies were analyzed. Polymorphisms in the main open reading frames were identified and compared to those in the main lineages of epidemiological concern: B.1.1.7 (UK) and B.1.351 (South Africa). RESULTS: Across 16 South American countries, 169 lineages were identified; major lineage B had the greatest diversity and broadest geographic distribution. Seventeen predominant lineages were analyzed revealing 2 dominant lineages of concern: P.1 (Brazilian variant) and B.1.1.7 with 94 and 28 genomes, respectively, both with 33 polymorphisms (other lineages displayed <=24 polymorphisms). A high number of polymorphisms were detected with a limited number of common variable positions, in common with the profile of the main lineages of epidemiological concern. CONCLUSIONS: The ever-increasing genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 continues to lead to novel lineage emergence. Various variants and lineages are now present across South America, dominated by major lineage B. The circulation of P.1 and B.1.1.7 and the high number of polymorphisms highlight the importance of genomic surveillance to determine introduction events, identify transmission chains, trace emergence, and implement prevention, vaccination and control strategies.

34946272|t|Immune Response after SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in Kidney Transplant Patients.
34946272|a|Background and Objectives: The prospective study was conducted to evaluate humoral and cellular immune responses after two doses of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine and possible relation with other factors (medication, etc.) in kidney transplant patients. Materials and Methods: Out of 167 vaccinated patients, 136 agreed to a follow-up visit three to six weeks after vaccination. Results: Only 39 patients (29%) developed antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 (>=35.2 binding antibody units (BAU)/mL) after full vaccination. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis showed that predictive factors for good antibody response to the COVID-19 vaccine were better kidney function, higher hemoglobin level, and no use of mycophenolate mofetil for immunosuppression. For seropositive kidney transplant patients there was a significant negative correlation between anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer and CD4/CD8 ratio (Spearman's correlation coefficient -0.4, p = 0.02), percentage of CD19+ cells (r = -0.37, p = 0.02), and a positive correlation with percentage of CD8+ cells (r = 0.4, p = 0.01). There was an increase of total leucocyte count after vaccination in the total studied population, and in the group of responders. Conclusions: Only one third of kidney transplant patients develop sufficient antibody responses after full COVID-19 vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech. Better kidney function, higher hemoglobin level, and no use of mycophenolate mofetil for immunosuppression increases the adequacy of response. The antibody titers correlated positively with relative number of CD8+ cells and negatively with CD4/CD8 ratio in responders.

34975897|t|Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immunoglobulin Isotypes, and Neutralization Activity Against Viral Variants, According to BNT162b2-Vaccination and Infection History.
34975897|a|Purpose: To compare SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific antibody production and plasma neutralizing capacity against B.1 wild-type-like strain, and Gamma/P.1 and Delta/B.1.617.2 variants-of-concern, in subjects with different Covid-19 disease and vaccination histories. Methods: Adult subjects were: 1) Unvaccinated/hospitalized for Covid-19; 2) Covid-19-recovered followed by one BNT162b2 vaccine dose; and 3) Covid-19-naive/2-dose BNT162b2 vaccinated. Multiplex Luminex  immunoassays measured IgG, IgA, and IgM plasma levels against SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), spike-1 (S), and nucleocapsid proteins. Neutralizing activity was determined in Vero E6 cytopathic assays. Results: Maximum anti-RBD IgG levels were similar in Covid-19-recovered individuals 8-10 days after single-dose vaccination and in Covid-19-naive subjects 7 days after 2nd vaccine dosing; both groups had  2-fold higher anti-RBD IgG levels than Unvaccinated/Covid-19 subjects tracked through 2 weeks post-symptom onset. Anti-S IgG expression patterns were similar to RBD within each group, but with lower signal strengths. Viral antigen-specific IgA and IgM levels were more variable than IgG patterns. Anti-nucleocapsid immunoglobulins were not detected in Covid-19-naive subjects. Neutralizing activity against the B.1 strain, and Gamma/P.1 and Delta/B.1.617.2 variants, was highest in Covid-19-recovered/single-dose vaccinated subjects; although neutralization against the Delta variant in this group was only 26% compared to B.1 neutralization, absolute anti-Delta titers suggested maintained protection. Neutralizing titers against the Gamma and Delta variants were 33-77% and 26-67%, respectively, versus neutralization against the B.1 strain (100%) in the three groups. Conclusion: These findings support SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine usefulness regardless of Covid-19 history, and confirm remarkable protection provided by a single vaccine dose in people who have recovered from Covid-19.

34959053|t|Isolation of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.28.2 (P2) variant and pathogenicity comparison with D614G variant in hamster model.
34959053|a|BACKGROUND: Considering the potential threat from emerging Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants and the rising COVID-19 cases, SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance is ongoing in India. We report herewith the isolation of the P.2 variant (B.1.1.28.2) from international travelers and further its pathogenicity evaluation and comparison with D614G variant (B.1) in hamster model. METHODS: Virus isolation was performed in Vero CCL81 cells and genomic characterization by next generation sequencing. The pathogenicity and host immune response of the isolate was assessed in Syrian hamster model and compared with B.1 variant. RESULTS: B.1.1.28.2 variant was isolated from nasal/throat swabs of international travelers returned to India from United Kingdom and Brazil. The B.1.1.28.2 variant induced body weight loss, viral replication in the respiratory tract and caused severe lung pathology in infected Syrian hamster model in comparison, with B.1 variant infected hamsters. The sera from B.1.1.28.2 infected hamsters efficiently neutralized the D614G variant virus whereas 6-fold reduction in the neutralization was seen in case of D614G variant infected hamsters' sera with the B.1.1.28.2 variant. CONCLUSIONS: B.1.1.28.2 lineage variant could be successfully isolated and characterization could be performed. Pathogenicity of the isolate was demonstrated in Syrian hamster model and the findings of neutralization reduction is of great concern and point towards the need for screening the vaccines for efficacy.

34960240|t|Serological Response to SARS-CoV-2 Messenger RNA Vaccine: Real-World Evidence from Italian Adult Population.
34960240|a|BACKGROUND: This study aims to investigate the extent of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine-induced antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a large cohort of Italian subjects belonging to the early vaccinated cohort in Italy. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted between December 2020 and May 2021. Three blood samples were collected for each participant: one at the time of the first vaccine dose (T0), one at the time of the second vaccine dose, (T1) and the third 30 days after this last dose (T2). RESULTS: We enrolled 2591 fully vaccinated subjects; 16.5% were frail subjects, and 9.8% were over 80 years old. Overall, 98.1% of subjects were seropositive when tested at T2, and 76.3% developed an anti-S IgG titer >=4160 AU/mL, which is adequate to develop viral neutralizing antibodies. Seronegative subjects at T1 were more likely to remain seronegative at T2 or to develop a low-intermediate anti-S IgG titer (51-4159 AU/mL). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, vaccination leads to detectable anti-S IgG titer in nearly all vaccine recipients. Stratification of the seroconversion level could be useful to promptly identify high-risk groups who may not develop a viral neutralizing response, even in the presence of seroconversion, and therefore may remain at higher risk of infection, despite vaccination.

33555604|a|A working group convened by the Section of Multiple Sclerosis and Neuroimmunology of the Polish Neurological Society has developed a statement with regard to the currently available mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) preventing novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) infection, which causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). This statement has been based on the literature available as of 15 January, 2021. The guidance will be updated as new data emerges. All data regarding the above-mentioned vaccines comes from clinical trials which have been reviewed, published and approved by the regulatory authorities [1, 2]. In the current manuscript, whenever a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is discussed, it refers to mRNA vaccines only.

34989330|t|Age-associated SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection and changes in immune response in mouse model.
34989330|a|ABSTRACTOlder individuals are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcome but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. In addition, how age modulates SARS-CoV-2 re-infection and vaccine breakthrough infections remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated age-associated SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, immune responses, and the occurrence of re-infection and vaccine breakthrough infection utilizing a wild type C57BL/6N mouse model. We demonstrated that interferon and adaptive antibody response upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge are significantly impaired in aged mice in comparison to young mice, which results in more effective virus replication and severe disease manifestations in the respiratory tract. Aged mice also showed increased susceptibility to re-infection due to insufficient immune protection acquired during primary infection. Importantly, two-dose COVID-19 mRNA vaccination conferred limited adaptive immune response among the aged mice which rendered them susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, our findings call for tailored and optimized treatment and prevention strategies against SARS-CoV-2 among the older individuals.

32722343|t|Molecular Tracing of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy in the First Three Months of the Epidemic.
32722343|a|The aim of this study is the characterization and genomic tracing by phylogenetic analyses of 59 new SARS-CoV-2 Italian isolates obtained from patients attending clinical centres in North and Central Italy until the end of April 2020. All but one of the newly-characterized genomes belonged to the lineage B.1, the most frequently identified in European countries, including Italy. Only a single sequence was found to belong to lineage B. A mean of 6 nucleotide substitutions per viral genome was observed, without significant differences between synonymous and non-synonymous mutations, indicating genetic drift as a major source for virus evolution. tMRCA estimation confirmed the probable origin of the epidemic between the end of January and the beginning of February with a rapid increase in the number of infections between the end of February and mid-March. Since early February, an effective reproduction number (Re) greater than 1 was estimated, which then increased reaching the peak of 2.3 in early March, confirming the circulation of the virus before the first COVID-19 cases were documented. Continuous use of state-of-the-art methods for molecular surveillance is warranted to trace virus circulation and evolution and inform effective prevention and containment of future SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.

33524990|t|BNT162b vaccines protect rhesus macaques from SARS-CoV-2.
33524990|a|A safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19 is urgently needed in quantities that are sufficient to immunize large populations. Here we report the preclinical development of two vaccine candidates (BNT162b1 and BNT162b2) that contain nucleoside-modified messenger RNA that encodes immunogens derived from the spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2, formulated in lipid nanoparticles. BNT162b1 encodes a soluble, secreted trimerized receptor-binding domain (known as the RBD-foldon). BNT162b2 encodes the full-length transmembrane S glycoprotein, locked in its prefusion conformation by the substitution of two residues with proline (S(K986P/V987P); hereafter, S(P2) (also known as P2 S)). The flexibly tethered RBDs of the RBD-foldon bind to human ACE2 with high avidity. Approximately 20% of the S(P2) trimers are in the two-RBD 'down', one-RBD 'up' state. In mice, one intramuscular dose of either candidate vaccine elicits a dose-dependent antibody response with high virus-entry inhibition titres and strong T-helper-1 CD4+ and IFNgamma+CD8+ T cell responses. Prime-boost vaccination of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) with the BNT162b candidates elicits SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titres that are 8.2-18.2x that of a panel of SARS-CoV-2-convalescent human sera. The vaccine candidates protect macaques against challenge with SARS-CoV-2; in particular, BNT162b2 protects the lower respiratory tract against the presence of viral RNA and shows no evidence of disease enhancement. Both candidates are being evaluated in phase I trials in Germany and the USA1-3, and BNT162b2 is being evaluated in an ongoing global phase II/III trial (NCT04380701 and NCT04368728).

35614287|t|Antibody response to BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine in adult patients with systemic sclerosis.
35614287|a|OBJECTIVES: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients are at risk for a severe disease course during SARS-CoV-2 infection either due to comorbidities or immunosuppression. The availability of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is crucial for the prevention of this hard-to-treat illness. The aim of this study is to assess the humoral response after mRNA vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in SSc patients. METHOD: Seropositivity rate and serum IgG levels were evaluated 1 month (t1) and 3 months (t3) after the second dose of vaccine in a cohort of SSc patients and healthy controls (HC). Differences were made with Student's or Mann-Whitney's t-test and with the chi-square or Fisher exact test. Logistic regression model including immunosuppressive treatments (corticosteroids, CCS; mycophenolate mofetil, MMF; methotrexate, MTX; rituximab, RTX) was built to assess the predictivity for seropositivity. RESULTS: The seropositivity rate was similar in 78 SSc patients compared to 35 HC at t1 but lower at t3. SSc patients had lower serum IgG levels than HC at t1 but not at t3. SSc patients treated with immunosuppressive therapy showed both a lower seropositive rate (t1, 90.3% vs 100%; t3, 87.1% vs 97.9%; p < 0.05) and serum IgG levels than untreated patients both at t1 [851 BAU/ml (IQR 294-1950) vs 1930 BAU/ml (IQR 1420-3020); p < 0.001] and t3 [266 BAU/ml (IQR 91.7-597) vs 706 BAU/ml (IQR 455-1330); p < 0.001]. In logistic regression analysis, only MTX was significant [OR 39.912 (95% CI 1.772-898.728); p < 0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: SSc patients treated with MTX had a lower serological response to mRNA vaccine, and even low doses of CCS can adversely affect antibody titer and vaccination response. Key Points   SSc patients are able to produce vaccine-induced antibodies after mRNA vaccination.   In SSc patients, clinical characteristics of disease did not influence seropositivity rate.   In SSc patients, even low doses of CCS can adversely affect antibody titer and vaccination response.   In SSc patients, MTX treatment is mainly associated with reduced seropositivity and lower serum IgG levels.

35605637|t|Effectiveness of CoronaVac in children 3 to 5 years during the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron outbreak in Chile.
35605637|a|The outbreak of the B.1.1.529 lineage of SARS-CoV-2 (Omicron) has caused an unprecedented number of COVID-19 cases, including pediatric hospital admissions. Policymakers urgently need evidence of vaccine effectiveness in children to balance the costs and benefits of vaccination campaigns, but to date, the evidence is sparse. Leveraging a population-based cohort in Chile of 490,694 children aged 3-5 years, we estimated the effectiveness of administering a two-dose schedule, 28 days apart, of Sinovac's inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (CoronaVac). We used inverse probability-weighted survival regression models to estimate hazard ratios of symptomatic COVID-19, hospitalization, and admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) for children with complete immunization over non-vaccination, accounting for time-varying vaccination exposure and relevant confounders. The study was conducted between December 6, 2021, and February 26, 2022, during the Omicron outbreak in Chile. The estimated vaccine effectiveness was 38.2% (95% confidence intervals, CI, 36.5-39.9) against symptomatic COVID-19, 64.6% (95%CI, 49.6-75.2) against hospitalization, and 69.0% (95%CI, 18.6-88.2) against ICU admission. The effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 was modest. However, protection against severe disease was high. These results support vaccination of children 3-5 years to prevent severe illness and associated complications and highlight the importance of maintaining layered protections against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

34974674|t|SARS-CoV-2 vaccination for adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease: expert consensus statement by KASID.
34974674|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel coronavirus, is threatening global health worldwide with unprecedented contagiousness and severity. The best strategy to overcome COVID-19 is a vaccine. Various vaccines are currently being developed, and mass vaccination is in progress. Despite the very encouraging clinical trial results of these vaccines, there is insufficient information on the safety and efficacy of vaccines for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients facing various issues. After reviewing current evidence and international guidelines, the Korean Association for the Study of Intestinal Diseases developed an expert consensus statement on COVID-19 vaccination issues for Korean IBD patients. This expert consensus statement emphasizes that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccination be strongly recommended for IBD patients, and it is safe for IBD patients receiving immunomodulatory therapy.

34994256|t|Association Between the Effectiveness and Immunogenicity of Inactivated SARS-CoV2 Vaccine (CoronaVac) with the Presence of Hypertension among Health Care Workers.
34994256|a|OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to observe the association between the presence of hypertension with Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness among healthcare workers who received CoronaVac vaccination. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study in Saiful Anwar General Hospital, Malang, Indonesia on 155 healthcare workers aged 18-59 years old who already received twice of the CoronaVac (Sinovac Life Science, Beijing, China) injection with 14-day intervals. Hypertension was diagnosed according to the 2020 International Society of Hypertension. Subjects were monitored for six months. The primary outcome was the rate of Covid-19 diagnosed by the pharyngeal swab for the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) examination. The secondary endpoints were: (1) severity of Covid-19 among infected participants; (2) rate of hospitalizations; and (3) anti-SRBD antibody levels measured by ECLIA. RESULTS: Among 155 participants, 18.7% of them were diagnosed with hypertension, and 31.0% had the desirable BP target according to the current guidelines. Subjects with hypertension, especially those with uncontrolled blood pressure, had a higher incidence of Covid-19 infection than subjects without hypertension. Subjects with symptomatic Covid-19 and hospitalized because of Covid-19 were higher in participants with hypertension. The anti-SRBD antibody levels were lower in the second month after CoronaVac vaccination in hypertensive subjects. In contrast, comparable anti-SRBD levels were seen from both groups at sixth months after vaccination. CONCLUSION: Hypertension was associated with lower vaccine effectiveness in healthcare workers. Subjects with hypertension had a higher risk of being infected with Covid-19 despite getting a complete dose of vaccination and lower antibody production.

35632398|t|Comparison of the Immunogenicity and Protective Efficacy of Various SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines among Healthcare Workers: Are Our White Coat Armies Protected?
35632398|a|BACKGROUND: The effective immunization of healthcare workers (HCWs) plays a vital role in preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. There is limited data on the immune response to vaccination among HCWs. We aim to determine seroprevalence rates and neutralizing IgG antibody response to various immunizations among HCWs. METHODS: This study was conducted between July and September 2021, in which blood samples were obtained from HCWs and SARS-CoV-2 IgG neutralizing antibodies were measured. Data regarding vaccination status with Pfizer/BioNTech, Sinopharm, or AstraZeneca vaccines, occupation, and prior COVID-19 infection were analyzed. RESULTS: COVID-19 infection post-vaccination was associated with higher mean antibody titers, regardless of vaccine type. Pfizer/BioNTech vaccination produced higher mean antibody titers for HCWs with prior COVID-19 infection (p < 0.00001) than other types of vaccines. Although 96% of HCWs were vaccinated, 3% were seronegative. For HCWs who were seropositive, there were no significant differences between the mean antibody titers when comparing occupations and blood indices. CONCLUSION: Awareness of the immunity status of HCWs is key to protecting this important group against SARS-CoV-2, especially those without prior COVID-19 infection. Further public health efforts regarding booster vaccination for HCWs are crucial to provide necessary antibody protection.

34952033|a|BACKGROUND: Data on the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination in people with a range of primary immune deficiencies are lacking since these patients were excluded from COVID-19 vaccine trials. This information may help in clinical management of this vulnerable patient group. OBJECTIVE: To assess humoral and T-cell immune responses after two doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in patients with PIDs and functional B-cell defects. METHODS: A double-center retrospective review of patients with PID who completed COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and who had humoral responses assessed through SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG antibody levels with reflex assessment of the antibody to block RBD binding to ACE2 (hereafter referred to as ACE2 receptor blocking activity, as a surrogate test for neutralization) and T-cell response evaluated by an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). Immunization reactogenicity was also reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 33 patients with humoral defect were evaluated. 69.6% received BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) and 30.3% received mRNA-1273 (Moderna). The mRNA vaccines were generally well tolerated without severe reactions. The IGRA was positive in 77.4% of our patients (24 of 31). About half of our subjects (16 of 33) had detectable RBD-specific IgG responses but only two of these 16 subjects had an ACE2 receptor blocking activity level of >50%. CONCLUSION: Vaccination of this cohort of PID patients with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines was safe and cellular immunity was stimulated in a majority. However, antibody responses to the spike protein RBD were less consistent, and, when detected, was not effective at ACE2 blocking. CLINICAL IMPLICATION: mRNA vaccination may be less effective at preventing acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 in our cohort of PID patients with functional B-cell defects. The Induction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific T-cell immunity by vaccination might help reduce the severity of disease in these patients.

34978571|t|Primary COVID-19 vaccine cycle and booster doses efficacy: analysis of Italian nationwide vaccination campaign.
34978571|a|We provide here an updated analysis of primary COVID-19 vaccination and vaccine booster doses efficacy, emerging from the ongoing Italian nationwide COVID-19 vaccination campaign. Primary COVID-19 vaccination efficacy was 76-92% within 6 months, decreasing to 34-80% after 6 months. Administration of vaccine booster doses decreased SARS-CoV-2 infections by 65%, COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths by 69% and 97% compared to vaccine efficacy after 6 months, but also decreased SARS-CoV-2 infections by 39% compared to vaccine efficacy within 6 months. These results suggest that COVID-19 vaccine booster doses are important for restoring vaccine efficacy and further limiting virus circulation.

34983583|t|Sequential immunization with SARS-CoV-2 RBD vaccine induces potent and broad neutralization against variants in mice.
34983583|a|The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by constantly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants still poses a threat to public health worldwide. Effective next-generation vaccines and optimized booster vaccination strategies are urgently needed. Here, we sequentially immunized mice with a SARS-CoV-2 wild-type inactivated vaccine and a heterologous mutant RBD vaccine, and then evaluated their neutralizing antibody responses against variants including Beta, Delta, Alpha, Iota, Kappa, and A.23.1. These data showed that a third booster dose of heterologous RBD vaccine especially after two doses of inactivated vaccines significantly enhanced the GMTs of nAbs against all SARS-CoV-2 variants we tested. In addition, the WT and variants all displayed good cross-immunogenicity and might be applied in the design of booster vaccines to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies.

34954088|t|Messenger Ribonucleic Acid Vaccines for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 - A Review.
34954088|a|The mRNA therapeutics have been studied since the 1970s and the currently available mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 are the culmination of decades of scientific research. The mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 have played a key role in our global response to the COVID-19 pandemic as they have demonstrated significant advantages over conventional vaccines and have proven to be highly effective against COVID-19 associated hospitalization and severe illness in large clinical trials and studies using real-world data.

34977553|t|Pharmacists-physicians collaborative intervention to reduce vaccine hesitancy and resistance: A randomized controlled trial.
34977553|a|Purpose: Given their negative influence on community health, vaccine hesitancy and resistance are emerging challenges that require healthcare intervention. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the impact of physician-pharmacist collaborative health coaching on rates of hesitancy and resistance for a COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: After an initial assessment of rates of hesitancy and resistance for a COVID-19 vaccine was conducted, hesitant and resistant participants were approached, recruited, and randomized into an active and control group. Pharmacists-physicians collaborative coaching intervention was delivered to active group subjects over two months through Facebook live sessions. The outcome measures were assessed in both groups before coaching, directly after coaching, and a month after coaching. Results: The proportions of hesitancy and resistance for a COVID-19 vaccine among subjects in the active group were significantly reduced from 64.3% and 35.7% before coaching to 20.1% and 7.8% directly after coaching, respectively. These proportions were further reduced to 11.1% and 3.3% a month after coaching, respectively. Furthermore, the mean scores for knowledge on, and attitude towards COVID-19 vaccine were significantly increased from 4.6 +- 1.8 and 4.1 +- 1.7 before coaching to 7.5 +- 3.1 and 8.9 +- 3.8 directly after coaching, respectively. However, the change in mean score of beliefs about COVID-19 vaccines among active group subjects was not significant. Conclusion: High rates of hesitancy and resistance for a COVID-19 vaccine were found in Jordan. These rates can be significantly reduced through online pharmacists-physicians collaborative coaching, which can also improve knowledge of and attitude towards COVID-19 vaccines.

34970399|t|Possible future trajectory of COVID-19: emphasis on Africa.
34970399|a|Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused morbidity and mortality in many countries. COVID-19 has also negatively affected the economy of several nations. The dynamics of interaction between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and host, and possible evolution of the virus into more virulent strains pose a threat to global eradication. With the advent of vaccination in most countries, vaccine hesitancy, especially in Africa, is expected to reduce. We also believe that the COVID-19 vaccine would have substantial impact on reducing incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths. A predictor model for COVID-19 infection pattern through to 2025 suggests that recurrent outbreaks are likely to occur. There is a prediction that Africa would not fully recover from the economic crises posed by the pandemic; nonetheless, we expect that economic activities on the continent will improve as countries undertake mass vaccinations and populace attain herd immunity. The growth of e-commerce has been remarkable during the pandemic and we don t expect trend to decline anytime soon. The pandemic has led to technology and digital platform utilization and/or improvement, which invariably has the tendency to improve quality of lives in the future. These include effective big data monitoring, online shopping, among others. Our future trajectory for recurrent waves of COVID-19 is that these may occur in winter months in temperate climates. We believe that COVID-19 has strengthened Africa s resilience to future pandemics.

34924406|t|Non-invasive brain microcurrent stimulation therapy of long-COVID-19 reduces vascular dysregulation and improves visual and cognitive impairment.
34924406|a|BACKGROUND: An effective treatment is needed for long-COVID patients which suffer from symptoms of vision and/or cognition impairment such as impaired attention, memory, language comprehension, or fatigue. OBJECTIVE: Because COVID-19infection causes reduced blood flow which may cause neuronal inactivation, we explored if neuromodulation with non-invasive brain stimulation with microcurrent (NIBS), known to enhance blood flow and neuronal synchronization, can reduce these symptoms. METHODS: Two female long-COVID patients were treated for 10-13 days with alternating current stimulation of the eyes and brain. While one patient (age 40) was infected with the SARS CoV-2 virus, the other (age 72) developed symptoms following AstraZeneca vaccination. Before and after therapy, cognition was assessed subjectively by interview and visual field using perimetry. One patient was also tested with a cognitive test battery and with a retinal dynamic vascular analyser (DVA), a surrogate marker of vascular dysregulation in the brain. RESULTS: In both patients NIBS markedly improved cognition and partially reversed visual field loss within 3-4 days. Cognitive tests in one patient confirmed recovery of up to 40-60% in cognitive subfunctions with perimetry results showing stable and visual field recovery even during follow-up. DVA showed that NIBS reduced vascular dysregulation by normalizing vessel dynamics (dilation/constriction), with particularly noticeable changes in the peripheral veins and arteries. CONCLUSIONS: NIBS was effective in improving visual and cognitive deficits in two confirmed SARS-COV-2 patients. Because recovery of function was associated with restoration of vascular autoregulation, we propose that (i) hypometabolic, "silent" neurons are the likely biological cause of long-COVID associated visual and cognitive deficits, and (ii) reoxygenation of these "silent" neurons provides the basis of neurological recovery. Controlled trials are now needed to confirm these observations.

34956759|t|Myocarditis Post Moderna Vaccination: Review of Criteria for Diagnosis.
34956759|a|Case reports of myocarditis post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA vaccination have not uniformly reported long-term follow-up beyond 90 days. We present a 23-year-old male who is typical of a patient presenting with myocarditis post-COVID-19 mRNA-1273 Moderna vaccination (young males, onset several days after second dose of the mRNA vaccine, and excellent short term complete recovery). Follow-up at 128 days revealed no residual sequelae in our patient. Although a definitive diagnosis of myocarditis requires an endomyocardial biopsy (EMB), diagnosis is usually made clinically and with imaging in most clinical settings unless part of an approved research protocol or if indicated clinically. We recommend active surveillance and reporting for myocarditis post mRNA vaccination and even consider reporting those with symptom onset beyond 90 days.

35632457|t|Evaluation of the Neutralizing Antibodies Response against 14 SARS-CoV-2 Variants in BNT162b2 Vaccinated Naive and COVID-19 Positive Healthcare Workers from a Northern Italian Hospital.
35632457|a|SARS-CoV-2 still represents a global health burden, causing more than six million deaths worldwide. Moreover, the emergence of new variants has posed new issues in terms of vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the neutralizing antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 variants in different cohorts of vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects. Four-fold diluted sera from SARS-CoV-2 naive and recovered subjects vaccinated with two or three doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine were challenged against 14 SARS-CoV-2 variants, and the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titer was measured. Results were compared with those obtained from unvaccinated COVID-19 recovered patients. Overall, a better SARS-CoV-2 NT Abs response was observed in recovered vaccinated subjects after three doses of the vaccine when compared to unvaccinated patients and vaccinated subjects with only two doses. Additionally, the lowest level of response was observed against the Omicron variant. In conclusion, third doses of BNT162b2 vaccine seems to elicit a sustained response against the large majority of variants.

32702299|t|Immunogenicity and safety of a recombinant adenovirus type-5-vectored COVID-19 vaccine in healthy adults aged 18 years or older: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial.
32702299|a|BACKGROUND: This is the first randomised controlled trial for assessment of the immunogenicity and safety of a candidate non-replicating adenovirus type-5 (Ad5)-vectored COVID-19 vaccine, aiming to determine an appropriate dose of the candidate vaccine for an efficacy study. METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial of the Ad5-vectored COVID-19 vaccine was done in a single centre in Wuhan, China. Healthy adults aged 18 years or older, who were HIV-negative and previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection-free, were eligible to participate and were randomly assigned to receive the vaccine at a dose of 1 x 1011 viral particles per mL or 5 x 1010 viral particles per mL, or placebo. Investigators allocated participants at a ratio of 2:1:1 to receive a single injection intramuscularly in the arm. The randomisation list (block size 4) was generated by an independent statistician. Participants, investigators, and staff undertaking laboratory analyses were masked to group allocation. The primary endpoints for immunogenicity were the geometric mean titres (GMTs) of specific ELISA antibody responses to the receptor binding domain (RBD) and neutralising antibody responses at day 28. The primary endpoint for safety evaluation was the incidence of adverse reactions within 14 days. All recruited participants who received at least one dose were included in the primary and safety analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04341389. FINDINGS: 603 volunteers were recruited and screened for eligibility between April 11 and 16, 2020. 508 eligible participants (50% male; mean age 39 7 years, SD 12 5) consented to participate in the trial and were randomly assigned to receive the vaccine (1 x 1011 viral particles n=253; 5 x 1010 viral particles n=129) or placebo (n=126). In the 1 x 1011 and 5 x 1010 viral particles dose groups, the RBD-specific ELISA antibodies peaked at 656 5 (95% CI 575 2-749 2) and 571 0 (467 6-697 3), with seroconversion rates at 96% (95% CI 93-98) and 97% (92-99), respectively, at day 28. Both doses of the vaccine induced significant neutralising antibody responses to live SARS-CoV-2, with GMTs of 19 5 (95% CI 16 8-22 7) and 18 3 (14 4-23 3) in participants receiving 1 x 1011 and 5 x 1010 viral particles, respectively. Specific interferon gamma enzyme-linked immunospot assay responses post vaccination were observed in 227 (90%, 95% CI 85-93) of 253 and 113 (88%, 81-92) of 129 participants in the 1 x 1011 and 5 x 1010 viral particles dose groups, respectively. Solicited adverse reactions were reported by 183 (72%) of 253 and 96 (74%) of 129 participants in the 1 x 1011 and 5 x 1010 viral particles dose groups, respectively. Severe adverse reactions were reported by 24 (9%) participants in the 1 x 1011 viral particles dose group and one (1%) participant in the 5 x 1010 viral particles dose group. No serious adverse reactions were documented. INTERPRETATION: The Ad5-vectored COVID-19 vaccine at 5 x 1010 viral particles is safe, and induced significant immune responses in the majority of recipients after a single immunisation.

34921776|t|The antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 Beta underscores the antigenic distance to other variants.
34921776|a|Alpha-B.1.1.7, Beta-B.1.351, Gamma-P.1, and Delta-B.1.617.2 variants of SARS-CoV-2 express multiple mutations in the spike protein (S). These may alter the antigenic structure of S, causing escape from natural or vaccine-induced immunity. Beta is particularly difficult to neutralize using serum induced by early pandemic SARS-CoV-2 strains and is most antigenically separated from Delta. To understand this, we generated 674 mAbs from Beta-infected individuals and performed a detailed structure-function analysis of the 27 most potent mAbs: one binding the spike N-terminal domain (NTD), the rest the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Two of these RBD-binding mAbs recognize a neutralizing epitope conserved between SARS-CoV-1 and -2, while 18 target mutated residues in Beta: K417N, E484K, and N501Y. There is a major response to N501Y, including a public IgVH4-39 sequence, with E484K and K417N also targeted. Recognition of these key residues underscores why serum from Beta cases poorly neutralizes early pandemic and Delta viruses.
